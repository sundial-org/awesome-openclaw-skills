# Anterior Cingulate Memory ⚡

**Conflict detection for AI agents.** Part of the AI Brain series.

## Status: 🚧 Under Development

This skill is being developed. Star/watch for updates!

## Concept

The anterior cingulate cortex monitors for errors and conflicts. This skill will give AI agents:

- **"Something's off" detection** — pre-conscious warning signals
- **Conflict monitoring** — detecting contradictions in information
- **Error tracking** — learning from mistakes
- **Uncertainty awareness** — knowing when to be cautious

## AI Brain Series

| Part | Function | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| [hippocampus](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/hippocampus) | Memory formation, decay, reinforcement | ✅ Live |
| [amygdala-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/amygdala-memory) | Emotional processing | ✅ Live |
| [basal-ganglia-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/basal-ganglia-memory) | Habit formation | 🚧 Development |
| **anterior-cingulate-memory** | Conflict detection | 🚧 Development |
| [insula-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/insula-memory) | Internal state awareness | 🚧 Development |

## Coming Soon

Based on neuroscience research on the ACC's role in error detection and cognitive control.
