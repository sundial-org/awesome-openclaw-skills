# Code Roaster

Get your code brutally roasted with humor AND useful feedback. Like a code review from that one senior dev who's funny but also right.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-roast ./your-file.js
```

## What It Does

- Roasts your code with savage (but accurate) commentary
- Points out actual problems behind the jokes
- Catches naming crimes, antipatterns, and WTFs
- Gives you real suggestions after the roast
- Makes code review actually entertaining

## Usage

```bash
# Roast a specific file
npx ai-roast ./src/index.js

# Roast your whole src folder
npx ai-roast ./src
```

## Example Output

```
🔥 Line 42: "password123" as a default? Bold strategy.
   FIX: Use environment variables for credentials.

💀 Line 89: A 200-line function named "doStuff"? 
   Truly a monument to ambiguity.
   FIX: Break into smaller, well-named functions.
```
