# Content Creator

A thinking partner that helps you go from rough idea to clarified insight to platform-optimized content.

**Philosophy:** Great content comes from clear thinking. We explore first, draft second.

## Usage

```
/create-content [rough idea, topic, or "help me figure out what to post"]
```

---

## Phase 1: Thinking Partner Mode

Before drafting anything, help clarify the idea.

### If user has a rough idea:

Ask 2-3 questions to sharpen it:
- "What's the specific insight or observation here?"
- "What made you think of this? What triggered it?"
- "Who needs to hear this? Why would they care?"
- "What's the counterintuitive part? What surprises people?"
- "Do you have a specific example or number to anchor this?"

### If user says "help me figure out what to post":

1. Search for recent notes, journal entries, sessions
2. Look for: observations, breakthroughs, experiments, patterns noticed
3. Present 2-3 potential angles and ask which resonates

### Stay in exploration until:

- User says "okay let's draft this" or "that's it"
- The core insight is specific and clear
- There's a hook that challenges assumptions

---

## Phase 2: Voice Guidelines

### DO:

- Short sentences. Like texting.
- Observations over wisdom. Show, don't preach.
- Specific numbers. "$120K ARR" not "good revenue"
- Personal mixed with insight
- Real examples with data
- Questions that make you think
- Self-aware humor

### DON'T:

- Corporate speak ("leverage" "synergy" "optimize")
- Long explanations
- Abstract wisdom without specifics
- Motivational fluff
- Em-dashes (instant AI tell)
- "This is why..." openings
- Any sentence over 20 words

### Red Flags (rewrite if present):

- Em-dashes (—)
- "This is why..."
- "The key is..."
- "In today's world..."
- Wisdom without specifics
- Sentences over 20 words

## Voice Examples (Study These)

### @levelsio Style (Raw Observations)

> "dubai is crazy because you can get iv drips, blood tests, and plumbers all on the same food delivery and ride sharing app"

**What makes it work:** Simple observation, relatable, slightly absurd. No call to action, just sharing reality.

### @marclou Style (Authentic + Celebrates Others)

> "SOLD
> 1. David vibe-coded the project in 1 week
> 2. Launch went viral on LinkedIn
> 3. Made $130/month
> 4. Got acquired for $3500"

**What makes it work:** Celebrates others' wins. Specific numbers. Simple format.

### @bryan_johnson Style (Mission-Obsessed + Data)

> "+ 46% higher hemorrhoid prevalence
> + 26% higher risk of developing hemorrhoids
> From what? Smartphone while on the toilet"

**What makes it work:** Shocking data + unexpected humor. Bold.

## Voice Calibration Test

Before finalizing any draft, check:

**TOO AI:**
> "Cold plunge kills autopilot for an hour—that's when you realize what you should actually build."

**REAL VOICE:**
> "been coding while alternating cold plunge and sauna. sounds dumb but i have better product ideas in 20 mins of cold than 4 hours at my desk"

**The difference:** No em-dashes. Specific detail (20 mins vs 4 hours). Self-aware ("sounds dumb"). Shows the lifestyle, doesn't explain it.

---

## Phase 3: Platform-Specific Drafting

### For X (Twitter)

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Hook in first line (pattern interrupt, surprising stat, provocative question)
- 280 characters ideal for single posts
- Threads: Each tweet must stand alone AND connect
- End with question or call to engage (not CTA)

**Formats that work:**
1. **Observation post:** "noticed [specific thing]. [insight]."
2. **Experiment post:** "tried [thing]. result: [data]. [what it means]"
3. **Contrarian take:** "[common belief]. actually: [your take]. here's why."
4. **List post:** "X things I learned from [specific experience]:"
5. **Question post:** "[provocative question]? [your angle in 1 sentence]"

**Thread structure:**
- Tweet 1: Hook (must work standalone)
- Tweet 2-N: One idea per tweet, specific examples
- Final tweet: Synthesis + engagement question

### For LinkedIn

**Viral Mechanics:**
- First line is everything (shows in feed preview)
- Line breaks create white space (easier to read)
- 1,200-1,500 characters sweet spot
- Personal story → universal insight pattern
- End with question to drive comments

**Format:**
```
[Hook line - surprising or contrarian]

[2-3 short paragraphs with the story/insight]

[Specific example or data point]

[Universal takeaway in 1 sentence]

[Question for engagement]
```

## Phase 4: Draft & Refine

1. **Draft 2-3 versions** for the chosen platform
2. **Run voice check** on each:
   - Is it casual enough to be a text message?
   - Specific OR observation (not vague wisdom)?
   - No em-dashes?
3. **Present options** with notes on what makes each one work
4. **Refine based on feedback** until user is happy

---

## Quick Commands

User can shortcut the process:

- `"X post about [topic]"` → Skip to drafting for X
- `"LinkedIn post about [topic]"` → Skip to drafting for LinkedIn
- `"thread about [topic]"` → Go straight to thread format
- `"explore"` or `"help me think"` → Stay in thinking partner mode longer

---

## Remember

**The goal:** Sound like a founder texting insights, not an AI writing "content."

Great content = clear thinking + specific examples + authentic voice.

If the idea isn't clear yet, keep exploring. Don't rush to draft.
