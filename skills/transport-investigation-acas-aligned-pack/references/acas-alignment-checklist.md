# ACAS alignment checklist (process-focused)

- Investigation stage is fact-finding (not outcome-setting)
- Neutral wording throughout; no presumption of guilt
- Right to be accompanied included (where applicable)
- Evidence handling is logged and share status recorded
- Questions are open first, then specific to evidence
- Notes and decisions (if later) are separated from evidence capture
