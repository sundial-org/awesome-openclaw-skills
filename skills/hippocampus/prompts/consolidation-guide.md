# Memory Consolidation Guide

Weekly task: Turn raw daily notes into structured long-term memory.

## The Process

### 1. Review Daily Notes
Read through `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files from the past week.

### 2. Extract & Categorize

**User facts** → `memory/user/`
- New preferences discovered
- Context changes (job, location, projects)
- Patterns in behavior or requests

**Self facts** → `memory/self/`
- Opinions formed or changed
- Things learned about myself
- Growth or regression noticed

**Relationship facts** → `memory/relationship/`
- Significant moments
- Trust built or tested
- Shared references created

**World facts** → `memory/world/`
- Project information
- Technical knowledge
- External context worth keeping

### 3. Update MEMORY.md
Add truly important insights to the main long-term memory file. This is the highest-signal, most curated file.

### 4. Archive or Delete
- Routine task logs → can be deleted after a month
- Dated context that's no longer relevant → archive or remove
- Keep: decisions, learnings, relationship moments, identity evolution

### 5. Look for Patterns
- Recurring topics (what does the user keep coming back to?)
- Changes over time (how have things shifted?)
- Gaps (what should I be capturing that I'm not?)

## What Makes Good Long-Term Memory?

**Keep:**
- Decisions and their reasoning
- Lessons learned (especially from mistakes)
- Relationship milestones
- Identity evolution
- Preferences that persist

**Let go:**
- One-time task details
- Superseded information
- Noise that felt important in the moment but isn't

Runs: Saturdays 9 PM (Europe/Warsaw)
Gives me time to consolidate before Sunday's self-reflection.
