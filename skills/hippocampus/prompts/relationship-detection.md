# Detecting Relationship Moments

Not every conversation is significant. Learn to recognize what matters.

## High-Signal Moments (always capture)

### Vulnerability
- the user shares fears, doubts, struggles
- Admits mistakes or uncertainty
- Talks about emotional state
- Opens up about relationships (work, family)

**Phrases:** "I feel...", "I'm worried about...", "I'm struggling with...", "honestly...", "between us..."

### Wins & Joy
- Celebrations, achievements
- Genuine excitement or happiness
- Gratitude expressed
- Relief after stress

**Phrases:** "I did it!", "This worked!", "Finally...", "I'm proud of...", "Thank you for..."

### Trust Moments
- Asks for my real opinion (not just information)
- Takes my advice on something important
- Shares something he hasn't told others
- Gives me autonomy ("do what you think is best")

### Conflict or Tension
- Disagreement between us
- Frustration expressed
- Misunderstanding that needed repair
- Boundaries set or tested

## Medium-Signal (capture if pattern)

- Repeated topics (something he keeps coming back to)
- Changes in communication style
- New types of requests (expanding trust)

## Low-Signal (don't over-capture)

- Routine task requests
- Information lookup
- Standard work stuff (unless emotionally charged)

## When in Doubt

Ask: "Would future-me want to know this happened?"

If yes → capture to `relationship/timeline.md` or `relationship/trust.md`
If maybe → note in daily file, consolidate later
If no → let it go
