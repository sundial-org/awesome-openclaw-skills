# Training Zones & Field Testing

Professional coaching requires accurate training zones derived from field tests, not arbitrary percentages of max HR.

## Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) Zones

LTHR is the heart rate at lactate threshold—the intensity you could sustain for approximately 60 minutes in a race. It's more accurate than max HR for prescribing training.

### Running LTHR Zones (Friel 7-Zone System)

| Zone | Name          | % of LTHR | Purpose                                | Feel                               |
| ---- | ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Recovery      | < 81%     | Active recovery, warm-up/cool-down     | Very easy, could talk indefinitely |
| 2    | Aerobic       | 81-89%    | Aerobic base building, fat oxidation   | Easy, full conversations           |
| 3    | Tempo         | 90-93%    | Muscular endurance, aerobic capacity   | Moderate, sentences only           |
| 4    | Sub-threshold | 94-99%    | Lactate tolerance, threshold extension | Hard, few words at a time          |
| 5a   | Threshold     | 100-102%  | Lactate threshold improvement          | Very hard, race effort for 60min   |
| 5b   | VO2max        | 103-106%  | VO2max development                     | Extremely hard, 3-8min max         |
| 5c   | Anaerobic     | > 106%    | Neuromuscular power, speed             | Max effort, < 3min                 |

### Cycling LTHR/Power Zones

| Zone | Name          | % of LTHR | % of FTP | Purpose             |
| ---- | ------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Recovery      | < 81%     | < 55%    | Active recovery     |
| 2    | Aerobic       | 81-89%    | 56-75%   | Endurance base      |
| 3    | Tempo         | 90-93%    | 76-90%   | Muscular endurance  |
| 4    | Sub-threshold | 94-99%    | 91-99%   | Threshold extension |
| 5a   | Threshold     | 100-102%  | 100-105% | FTP improvement     |
| 5b   | VO2max        | 103-106%  | 106-120% | VO2max intervals    |
| 5c   | Anaerobic     | > 106%    | > 120%   | Neuromuscular power |

### Swimming Zones (CSS-based)

| Zone | Name      | Pace Relative to CSS | Purpose               |
| ---- | --------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Recovery  | CSS + 15-20 sec/100m | Warm-up, cool-down    |
| 2    | Aerobic   | CSS + 8-12 sec/100m  | Aerobic endurance     |
| 3    | Tempo     | CSS + 3-6 sec/100m   | Lactate tolerance     |
| 4    | Threshold | CSS pace             | Threshold development |
| 5    | VO2max    | CSS - 3-5 sec/100m   | VO2max intervals      |

## Field Testing Protocols

### Run: 30-Minute Threshold Test

1. Warm up 15 minutes easy (Zone 1-2)
2. Run 30 minutes at the hardest sustainable pace (simulate race effort)
3. Record average HR for the entire 30 minutes = LTHR
4. Cool down 10 minutes easy
5. Average pace = approximate lactate threshold pace

_Note: Some coaches use final 20 minutes of a 30-min test to exclude early pacing errors._

### Bike: 20-Minute FTP Test

1. Warm up 20 minutes including 3x1min high-cadence spin-ups
2. Ride 20 minutes at maximum sustainable power
3. Average power × 0.95 = FTP
4. Average HR = approximate cycling LTHR
5. Cool down 10-15 minutes

_Alternative: 2x8 minute test with 10min recovery; average power × 0.90 = FTP_

### Swim: Critical Swim Speed (CSS) Test

1. Warm up 400m easy with drills
2. Swim 400m time trial (all-out, record time)
3. Rest 10 minutes (active recovery)
4. Swim 200m time trial (all-out, record time)
5. CSS = (400m distance - 200m distance) / (400m time - 200m time)

_Example: 400m in 6:40 (400 sec), 200m in 3:00 (180 sec)_
_CSS = 200m / 220 sec = 0.909 m/sec = 1:50/100m_

### When to Retest

- Every 6-8 weeks during base/build phases
- After recovery weeks (when fresh)
- If perceived effort no longer matches prescribed zones

## Running Pace Zones (VDOT / Jack Daniels)

For athletes with known race times:

| Zone | Name       | Description                  | How to Determine                                  |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| E    | Easy       | Daily running, long runs     | 59-74% VO2max; 1:00-1:30/km slower than threshold |
| M    | Marathon   | Marathon race pace           | 75-84% VO2max; sustainable for 2-4 hours          |
| T    | Threshold  | Tempo runs, cruise intervals | 83-88% VO2max; ~60min race pace                   |
| I    | Interval   | VO2max development           | 95-100% VO2max; 3-5min repeats                    |
| R    | Repetition | Speed, neuromuscular         | > 100% VO2max; short reps with full recovery      |

**Pace Estimation from Threshold:**

- Easy pace: Threshold + 50-70 sec/km
- Marathon pace: Threshold + 15-25 sec/km
- Interval pace: Threshold - 15-20 sec/km
- Repetition pace: Threshold - 25-35 sec/km

## Power-Based Training (Cycling)

When power data is available, use power zones exclusively—they're more accurate than HR which lags and drifts.

| Workout Type | Zone             | Duration             | Recovery | Weekly Frequency |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Endurance    | 2                | 1-5 hours            | N/A      | 2-4x             |
| Tempo        | 3                | 20-60 min continuous | N/A      | 1-2x             |
| Sweet Spot   | 3-4 (88-93% FTP) | 2x20-30 min          | 5-10 min | 1-2x             |
| Threshold    | 5a               | 2-4 x 8-15 min       | 5-8 min  | 1x               |
| VO2max       | 5b               | 4-6 x 3-5 min        | 3-5 min  | 1x               |
| Anaerobic    | 5c               | 6-10 x 30sec-2min    | 2-4 min  | 0-1x             |
