# What to check next (tacho triage prompts)

Use these prompts to avoid guessing causes.

## Break/rest issues
- Check shift plan vs actual: delays, waiting time, multi-drop, customer queues
- Check whether breaks were taken but not recorded correctly (where relevant)
- Check whether the driver understood break requirements for the duty type
- Check if routes/schedules make compliance unrealistic

## Manual entries / mode errors
- Check card insertion/removal timing and manual entry completeness
- Check whether “other work/availability/POA” categorisation matches your policy
- Check for training need on head unit steps (without assuming intent)

## Speeding/telematics-linked concerns (if provided)
- Confirm source and timestamp alignment
- Check context (road type, limit changes, vehicle class)

## Data integrity / missing days
- Check download cadence and device issues
- Check whether records are incomplete before concluding non-compliance
