# Common infringement patterns (use as a checklist, not a conclusion)

- Insufficient break: often schedule pressure, misunderstanding, or poor break planning
- Reduced rest patterns: may indicate late returns, early starts, or poor rota design
- Mode errors/manual entries: often training/process gaps, device issues, or rushed end-of-shift steps
- Repeat same-type infringements: may indicate systemic planning issue rather than individual behaviour

Rule: always verify against the specific record extract before writing conclusions.
