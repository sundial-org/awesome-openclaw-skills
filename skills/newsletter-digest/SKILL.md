# Newsletter Digest

Tame your inbox. Get AI summaries of newsletters and articles so you read what matters.

## What it does

Processes forwarded newsletters and linked articles, extracts key insights, creates prioritized reading lists, and learns your interests over time. Never miss important content, never drown in noise.

## Usage

**Summarize content:**
```
"Summarize this newsletter" [forward/paste]
"Digest https://article-url.com"
"What's important in my newsletters today?"
```

**Build reading lists:**
```
"Add to reading list: [url]"
"What's on my reading list?"
"Clear completed reads"
```

**Get insights:**
```
"Key takeaways from tech newsletters this week"
"Trending topics across my subscriptions"
"Compare viewpoints on [topic]"
```

**Manage preferences:**
```
"I'm interested in AI, fintech, productivity"
"Skip newsletters about marketing"
"Prioritize Stratechery"
```

## Features

- **Smart summaries**: Key points, not just shortened text
- **Topic extraction**: Tags and categorizes automatically
- **Cross-reference**: Finds related content across sources
- **Save for later**: Queue articles for focused reading time

## Tips

- Forward newsletters to Clawd for processing
