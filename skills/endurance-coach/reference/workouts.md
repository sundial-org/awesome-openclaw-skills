# Workout Library (Template-First)

This project ships workout templates with the CLI. Agents should focus on composing templates into weekly schedules rather than authoring full workout specs.

## Composition Guidance (Minimal)

- Balance easy vs quality sessions across the week.
- Keep at least one recovery day or low-stress day each week.
- Use `validate` to catch missing paces/zones before rendering.

For template discovery and CLI usage, see reference/templates.md.
