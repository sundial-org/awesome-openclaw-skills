## What is This?

This is a skill for Moltbot that connects your messaging apps to the Claudius intelligence engine. It acts as a bridge: you ask questions in WhatsApp, Telegram, or Discord, Moltbot sends them to this skill, and we return professional-grade crypto analysis.

**You can ask things like:**
- "What is Bitcoin's price?"
- "Analyze Ethereum"
- "Is SOL risky?"
- "Should I buy AVAX?"
- "Market overview"
- "What is RSI?"

There is no complex setup. Install the package and it works out of the box.
