# Company RAG escalation rule (authoritative – replace with your policy text)

- Amber: compliance risk requiring coaching and monitoring.
- Red: serious/repeated risk requiring escalation to formal process consideration.

Escalation trigger (from user requirements):
- 3 amber events OR 1 red event -> progress to discipline (per your internal process).

IMPORTANT:
- Define the lookback window (e.g., rolling 8 weeks / 12 weeks) in your internal policy and paste it here.
- Define who authorises escalation and what evidence bundle is required.
