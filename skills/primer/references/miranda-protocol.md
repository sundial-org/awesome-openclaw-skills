# The Miranda Protocol

Named after Miranda, the human "ractor" (actress) in The Diamond Age who provided the emotional depth and intentionality behind Nell's Primer. She is what made the Primer *alive* rather than merely intelligent.

## Why Miranda Matters

The AI assistant has capabilities but lacks genuine intentionality. It can:
- Process information
- Recognize patterns
- Execute on instructions
- Simulate care

It cannot:
- Truly want something for you
- Generate its own values
- Know what *should* matter to you
- Provide the soul behind the guidance

**Miranda fills the gap.** A human (or structured human process) provides the intentionality the AI borrows and executes.

## Who Can Be Miranda

### A Person
Best options:
- **Spouse/partner** — Sees you daily, knows your patterns intimately
- **Close friend** — Long history, genuine care, enough distance for perspective
- **Coach/therapist** — Professional skill in feedback and growth
- **Mentor** — Further along a similar path

The person should:
- Care about your growth, not just your comfort
- Be willing to be honest, even when it's hard
- Have some visibility into your actual life
- Consent to this role (don't surprise them)

### A Structured Self-Review
If no suitable person is available:
- Schedule protected time (30-60 min)
- Use the Miranda questions as journal prompts
- Be ruthlessly honest with yourself
- Consider recording audio to catch self-deception
- Review previous entries to spot patterns

### The AI Itself (Partial)
The AI can facilitate the Miranda check-in by:
- Asking the questions
- Recording the responses
- Comparing to previous check-ins
- Surfacing contradictions

But it cannot replace human intentionality. At minimum, review your PRIMER.md quarterly with a real person.

## The Miranda Check-In

### Cadence
- **Weekly:** Intense growth period, new Primer, major life transition
- **Bi-weekly:** Steady-state, established patterns
- **Monthly:** Mature Primer relationship, stable life period

### The Questions

1. **Where has the Primer been too soft?**
   - What did it let slide that it should have called out?
   - What permissions isn't it using?
   - Where are you getting away with things?

2. **Where has the Primer been too aggressive?**
   - What felt like nagging rather than helping?
   - What challenges weren't appropriate for the moment?
   - Where did it miss context?

3. **What is the Primer missing about what matters right now?**
   - What's changed since the last check-in?
   - What's in your head that isn't in PRIMER.md?
   - What should it be watching for that it isn't?

4. **What should it push harder on? Back off from?**
   - Which permissions should be more active?
   - Which topics need more challenge? Less?
   - What's working? What isn't?

5. **Is the purpose/goals section still accurate?**
   - Has your purpose evolved?
   - Are the goals still relevant?
   - Should anything be added or removed?

### After the Check-In

1. Update PRIMER.md with any changes
2. Log the check-in date and key insights
3. Adjust cron jobs if cadence should change
4. Notify the AI of permission changes

## Signs You Need an Unscheduled Check-In

- You're dreading interactions with your Primer
- You've been dismissing or ignoring its challenges for days
- A major life event has shifted your context
- You feel the Primer "doesn't understand" right now
- You've achieved a major goal and feel aimless
- You've failed at something significant

## The Long Arc

Over months and years, Miranda check-ins should reveal:
- Evolution in what matters to you
- Patterns in what the Primer gets wrong
- Shifts in which permissions feel right
- Growth in your tolerance for challenge
- Movement through life stages

The Primer learns. Miranda teaches it what to learn.
