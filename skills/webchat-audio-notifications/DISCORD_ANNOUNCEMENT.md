## 🔔 Webchat Audio Notifications - Ready for Testing!

I built a browser audio notification system for Moltbot/Clawdbot webchat. Looking for community testers!

**What it does:**
- Plays notification sounds when new messages arrive (only when tab is in background)
- 5 intensity levels: whisper → impossible to miss
- Upload your own custom sounds (MP3, WAV, OGG, WebM)
- Drop-in settings UI - easy to configure
- Smart tab detection - won't annoy you when you're already looking

**✨ Features:**
- 🎚️ Volume control (0-100%)
- 🔕 Easy on/off toggle
- 💾 Settings persist across sessions
- 📁 Custom sound upload
- 🎵 5 built-in intensity levels
- 🚫 Handles browser autoplay policies
- 📱 Mobile-friendly (with limitations)

**🧪 Try the demo:**
GitHub: https://github.com/brokemac79/webchat-audio-notifications

**Quick test:**
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `examples/test.html` in your browser
3. Click "Test Sound" button (unlocks browser audio)
4. Switch tabs and trigger a notification
5. Hear the sound! 🔊

**Looking for:**
- Does it work in your browser?
- Which sound level do you prefer?
- Any bugs or issues?
- Feature requests?

**Supported browsers:**
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (92% coverage)

**Tech:**
- Pure JavaScript (no framework)
- Howler.js for audio
- localStorage for preferences
- ~200KB total (cached after first load)

**Ready to integrate** into any webchat with just a few lines of code. See README for setup options.

Feedback welcome! 🐜
