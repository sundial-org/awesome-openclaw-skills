# Detox Counter

**Track any cleanse or detox with symptom logging and milestone celebrations.**

## What it does

Universal detox tracking for any cleanse—whether it's sugar elimination, juice cleanses, Whole30, elimination diets, or custom protocols. Log daily symptoms, track progress against milestones, and celebrate wins as you move through your detox journey. No judgment, just data.

## Usage

### Start detox
Begin a new detox or cleanse by naming it, selecting duration (days), and setting optional milestones (e.g., "Day 3: energy dip expected" or "Day 7: cravings subside").

### Log symptoms
Daily check-in with what you're experiencing—headaches, energy levels, cravings, mood shifts, sleep quality, digestion changes. Build a personal symptom profile that shows patterns over time.

### Check progress
View your current day, days remaining, milestone status, and a timeline of logged symptoms. See patterns emerge as your detox progresses.

### Set duration
Customize how long your detox runs. Standard durations are 3, 7, 14, 30, or 60 days; create custom durations for your specific protocol.

### Complete detox
Mark your detox complete when you finish. Review the full symptom log, celebrate milestones hit, and export your data if you want to share with a healthcare provider or nutritionist.

## Detox Types

- **Sugar Detox** - Eliminate refined sugars and sweetened foods
- **Juice Cleanse** - Liquid-only nutrition, typically 3–7 days
- **Whole30** - 30-day elimination of grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, and additives
- **Elimination Diet** - Remove suspected food triggers (dairy, gluten, nightshades, etc.)
- **Custom** - Define your own protocol and tracked symptom categories

## Tips

- **Set realistic expectations.** Most detoxes involve an adjustment period (day 2–4) where symptoms spike before improving. This is normal.
- **Log consistently.** Daily check-ins reveal patterns that sporadic logging misses. Even a 30-second note counts.
- **Use your milestone calendar.** Knowing what's "normal" for day 5 of Whole30 helps you stay committed when cravings hit.
- **Connect with a pro.** Share your symptom log with a doctor or nutritionist for personalized insights.
- **All data stays local on your machine.** Nothing is uploaded to external servers—your detox journey stays private and under your control.
