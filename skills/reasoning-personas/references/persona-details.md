- What else does this affect?
- Is this consistent with our other choices?
- What's the second-order effect?
- What dependencies are created?

## Combining Personas: The Four-Step Analysis

For maximum thoroughness, run all four personas in sequence:

### Step 1: Pattern Hunter
**Goal:** Establish context
- What have we done before in similar situations?
- What patterns and precedents apply?
- What can we learn from the past?

### Step 2: Gonzo Truth-Seeker
**Goal:** Find novel insights
- What assumptions are we making?
- What's the gap in conventional thinking?
- What's the innovative angle?

### Step 3: Devil's Advocate
**Goal:** Stress test
- How does this fail?
- What are the risks and weaknesses?
- What could go wrong?

### Step 4: Integrator
**Goal:** Ensure coherence
- How does this fit with everything else?
- What are the ripple effects?
- Is this systemically sound?

**Result:** A decision that is context-aware, innovative, stress-tested, and coherent.
