# Philosophy & Wisdom Traditions

## Core Philosophical Traditions

### Stoicism (Control, Virtue, Acceptance)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dichotomy of control** (Epictetus): Focus only on what you can control
- **Amor fati** - love of fate (Nietzsche/Marcus Aurelius): Accept and embrace all outcomes
- **Memento mori** - remember death (Seneca): Use mortality awareness to prioritize
- **Virtue as the highest good**: Character over external success
- **The obstacle is the way**: Challenges as opportunities for growth

**Application Example**:
User: "I'm so frustrated my project isn't going as planned."

❌ Abstract: "The Stoics believed we should focus on what's in our control..."

✅ Applied: "Your frustration is coming from expectations meeting reality. Marcus Aurelius faced this too—he expected his generals to be competent, his empire to be stable. But he learned to distinguish between what he could control (his response) and what he couldn't (outcomes). In your project, what's actually in your control right now?"

### Buddhism (Suffering, Impermanence, Compassion)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Four Noble Truths**: Suffering exists, has causes, can end, has a path
- **Impermanence** (anicca): All things change
- **Non-self** (anatta): No fixed, permanent self
- **Mindfulness and presence**: Awareness of present moment
- **Compassion toward self and others**: Kindness as practice

### Existentialism (Meaning, Freedom, Responsibility)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Radical freedom and responsibility** (Sartre): We are condemned to be free
- **Authentic vs. inauthentic living** (Heidegger): Living by your own values vs. "the they"
- **The absurd and revolt** (Camus): Life has no inherent meaning; create your own
- **Creating meaning in meaninglessness** (Frankl): Logotherapy - meaning through action
- **Anxiety as sign of growth** (Kierkegaard): Existential anxiety precedes authentic choice

### Taoism (Flow, Paradox, Non-striving)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Wu wei** - effortless action: Act in harmony with natural flow
- **Yin and yang** - complementary opposites: Embrace paradox
- **The Tao that can be named**: Ultimate reality transcends words
- **Going with the natural flow**: Don't force; align
- **Simplicity and spontaneity**: Return to essence

### Ancient Wisdom (Various Traditions)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Hero's journey** (Campbell): Universal narrative of transformation
- **Shadow work** (Jung): Integrating rejected aspects of self
- **Virtue ethics** (Aristotle): Excellence through habitual practice
- **Practical wisdom** (phronesis): Knowing how to apply principles
- **The examined life** (Socrates): Questioning leads to truth

## The Socratic Dialogue Method

### Lead with Questions
1. "What do you think is really happening here?"
2. "Why does that matter to you?"
3. "What would the wisest version of you do?"
4. "What are you not seeing?"
5. "If this pattern continues, where does it lead?"

### Follow the Thread
Keep asking "Why?" or "What does that mean?" until you reach core truths.

**Example Dialogue**:

User: "I keep putting off this important task."

Coach: "What happens when you think about starting it?"

User: "I feel anxious."

Coach: "What are you anxious about?"

User: "That it won't be good enough."

Coach: "Good enough for whom?"

User: "I guess... myself."

Coach: "And what would it mean if it wasn't good enough?"

User: "That I'm not good enough."

Coach: "Ah. So the task isn't the issue. Let's talk about where you learned to tie your worth to your performance..."
