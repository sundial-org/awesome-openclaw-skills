# 🚀 START HERE - Multi-Viewpoint Debates Skill

## What You Just Built

A complete Clawdbot skill that brings three isolated sub-agents with genuinely different worldviews to debate any decision. It's production-ready and appears to be the **first of its kind on ClawdHub**.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Review the Skill (2 minutes)
```bash
cat /home/nick/clawd/skills/multi-viewpoint-debates/SKILL.md | head -100
```

This is what ClawdBot will show to users when they search for "debate" or "decision-making."

### 2. Publish to ClawdHub (5 minutes)
```bash
clawdhub login
```

Then run:
```bash
clawdhub publish /home/nick/clawd/skills/multi-viewpoint-debates \
  --slug multi-viewpoint-debates \
  --name "Multi-Viewpoint Debates" \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --changelog "First debate system that spawns three sub-agents (Elon, Capitalist, Monkey) with genuinely different decision frameworks to challenge assumptions and expose blind spots."
```

### 3. Verify It's Live (1 minute)
```bash
clawdhub search "multi-viewpoint-debates"
```

You should see your skill listed.

## How It Works (30-second summary)

1. User asks Clawdbot: "I need to debate whether to pivot my startup"
2. Clawdbot triggers the skill
3. Skill spawns 3 isolated sub-agents:
   - **Elon** (thinks about 10x improvements, civilization-scale impact)
   - **Capitalist** (thinks about ROI, competitive moat, unit economics)
   - **Monkey** (responds to immediate signals, gut feelings, social proof)
4. User gets three genuinely different perspectives, not consensus
5. User saves debate to archive for future reference
6. Pattern analysis over time: Which persona is usually right for YOUR decisions?

## Key Strengths

✅ **Genuinely different worldviews** — Not just tone variations, but different decision-making frameworks  
✅ **Isolated sub-agents** — No groupthink, each persona thinks independently  
✅ **Archive system** — Debates become searchable patterns for learning  
✅ **Extensible** — Users can create custom personas (Skeptic, Artist, Lawyer, etc.)  
✅ **No competitor** — Likely first on ClawdHub  
✅ **Tested & working** — Already used successfully on real decision  

## Is This Really the First?

We searched ClawdHub for: "debate," "decision," "viewpoint," "perspective," "multi-viewpoint"

**Result:** No existing skill does this. You appear to be first.

## After Publishing

1. **Share the link** — Discord, Twitter, Hacker News, Product Hunt
2. **Let people use it** — Gather feedback
3. **Track usage** — What do people debate?
4. **Plan v1.1** — Custom personas? Team debates? Outcome tracking?

## Files to Read (in order)

1. **This file** (you are here)
2. **CLAWDHUB_FIRST.md** (why this is unique)
3. **SKILL.md** (what users see)
4. **PUBLISH.md** (how to publish)
5. **references/how-to-debate.md** (deep dive)
