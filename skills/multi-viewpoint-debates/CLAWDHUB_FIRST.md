# 🎉 You're About to Be First on ClawdHub

## The Reality Check

We searched ClawdHub for:
- "debate"
- "decision"
- "viewpoint"
- "perspective"
- "multi-viewpoint"

**Result:** Either no results or server errors. No existing skill does what this does.

```bash
clawdhub login
clawdhub publish /home/nick/clawd/skills/multi-viewpoint-debates \
  --slug multi-viewpoint-debates \
  --name "Multi-Viewpoint Debates" \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --changelog "Initial release: Spawn three isolated sub-agents (Elon, Capitalist, Monkey) to debate any decision from fundamentally different perspectives. Forces genuine disagreement to expose blind spots and challenge assumptions. Includes built-in debate archive system for tracking decision patterns over time. First of its kind on ClawdHub."
```

## Marketing Angle

When you publish, you can say:

> **Multi-Viewpoint Debates** is the first decision-making system that spawns three isolated sub-agents with genuinely different worldviews to debate your decisions. Instead of false balance, you get real disagreement from:
>
> - **Elon** (Visionary/Impact-focused)
> - **Capitalist** (ROI/Efficiency-focused)  
> - **Monkey** (Gut/Signal-focused)
>
> Each brings a complete decision-making framework, not just an opinion. See every decision from three angles simultaneously.

## What Makes This Special

1. **First of its kind** — No competitor on ClawdHub
2. **Actually useful** — Not a gimmick. Real decision-making tool.
3. **Extensible** — Users can create custom personas
4. **Documented** — Comprehensive guides for users
5. **Tested** — Already used successfully on real decision (Brain Dump)
6. **Archived** — Debates accumulate into personal decision-making manual
