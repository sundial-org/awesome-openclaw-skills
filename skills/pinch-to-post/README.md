## ❓ FAQ

**Does this work with WordPress.com?**  
Only WordPress.com Business/eCommerce plans (they have REST API access). Self-hosted WordPress works perfectly.

**What about custom post types?**  
Yes! Any post type registered with the REST API works out of the box.

**Will this break my site?**  
No. Everything uses the official WordPress REST API—the same system the block editor uses. If your site works, this works.

**Do I need to install a plugin?**  
Nope. WordPress has REST API built-in since version 4.7. Just generate an Application Password and you're set.

**What permissions does my user need?**  
Administrator for full access, Editor for content management, Author for their own posts only.

**Is my password stored securely?**  
Your Application Password stays in your local Clawdbot config. It's never sent anywhere except your own WordPress site.

**Can I use this with WP Engine / Kinsta / Flywheel?**  
Yes. Works with any WordPress host that hasn't disabled the REST API (almost none do).

**What about multisite (WordPress Network)?**  
Yes! Set up each subsite as a separate site in your config.
