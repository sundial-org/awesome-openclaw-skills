# X Algorithm Mastery

X (Twitter) algorithm rules, viral strategies, and article best practices. Boost engagement, avoid reach death, write posts that actually perform.

## Install

**ClawdHub:**
```bash
clawdhub install NextFrontierBuilds/x-algorithm
```

**npm:**
```bash
npm install x-algorithm
```

## The Golden Rules

1. **First 2 hours are critical** — engagement in this window determines reach
2. **No external links in main post** — put links in replies
3. **Media > Text** — videos 10x, images 2-3x engagement
4. **Reply to EVERYTHING** — replies weighted highest
5. **Post 8 AM - 2 PM** — when your audience is awake
6. **Controversy drives engagement** — pick battles wisely
7. **Threads > single tweets** — for long-form

## What Kills Reach

- ❌ External links in main post
- ❌ Getting reported/blocked
- ❌ Posting same content repeatedly
- ❌ Not replying to comments
- ❌ Corporate/formal tone

## What Works

- ✅ Questions that invite replies
- ✅ Hot takes (mildly controversial)
- ✅ Personal stories
- ✅ Step-by-step threads
- ✅ Replying to your own posts

## Sources

Based on X's open-source algorithm, Hootsuite/Sprout Social research, and analysis of viral articles from top creators.
