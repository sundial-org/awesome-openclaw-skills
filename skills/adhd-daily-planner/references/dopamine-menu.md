# The Dopamine Menu

A personalized toolkit of activities organized by effort level and dopamine payoff, designed for ADHD brains that need quick wins and sustainable motivation.

## Understanding Dopamine and ADHD

```
NEUROTYPICAL DOPAMINE:
Task → Steady dopamine → Sustained motivation → Completion → Reward

ADHD DOPAMINE:
Task → Weak dopamine signal → No motivation → Avoidance
        OR
Interesting task → MASSIVE dopamine → Hyperfocus → Crash

THE GOAL:
Create reliable dopamine sources that work WITH your brain,
not against it.
```

## The Dopamine Menu Concept

Create a personalized menu of activities across effort levels:

## How to Use the Menu

### Building Your Personal Menu
```
1. BRAINSTORM: List activities that give YOU dopamine
   (Not what "should" - what actually works)

2. CATEGORIZE: Sort by effort level honestly
   (A walk might be appetizer for some, main course for others)

3. ACCESSIBILITY CHECK:
   - Can you do appetizers RIGHT NOW with zero prep?
   - Are starters available without leaving home?
   - Are main courses realistic for your schedule?

4. BALANCE CHECK:
   - Mix of physical/mental/social/creative
   - Some productive, some purely fun
   - Healthy and "junk food" dopamine both allowed

5. POST IT: Keep visible where you work
```

### Using the Menu Day-to-Day

**Morning:**
- Start with an appetizer to wake up brain
- Use a starter to build momentum before hard work

**Work blocks:**
- Appetizer between tasks
- Starter after completing something hard

**Afternoon slump:**
- Main course break if possible
- Multiple appetizers if not

**Evening:**
- Main course as reward for day
- Dessert for special accomplishments

**Weekend:**
- Plan one dessert activity
- Sprinkle main courses throughout
- Don't just binge junk dopamine

## Dopamine Don'ts

### The Dopamine Traps
```
TRAP: Endless scrolling
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK: Variable reward = addiction pattern, not satisfaction

TRAP: Binge watching "one more episode"
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK: Passive consumption, no accomplishment feeling

TRAP: Impulse shopping
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK: Anticipation > receipt, then guilt/clutter

TRAP: Comfort eating
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK: Blood sugar crash, shame spiral

TRAP: Hyperfocusing on hobby instead of responsibility
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK: Feels good now, anxiety/consequences later
```

### Harm Reduction for Junk Dopamine
You're going to do these sometimes. Make them less harmful:

**Scrolling:**
- Set timer before starting
- Use app limits (Screen Time, etc.)
- Make feed useful (follow inspiring accounts)
- Scroll standing up (you'll stop sooner)

**Binge watching:**
- Schedule it (Friday night = binge time)
- Watch WITH someone
- Do something physical during
- Stop at natural breakpoints

**Gaming:**
- Scheduled sessions, not reactive
- Social games over solo isolation
- Hard stop when timer goes
- No gaming before responsibilities

## Temptation Bundling

Pair unpleasant tasks with dopamine sources:

```
BORING TASK          +    DOPAMINE SOURCE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Data entry           +    Favorite podcast
Exercise             +    New playlist/audiobook
Cleaning             +    True crime documentary
Commuting            +    Engaging audiobook
Meal prep            +    Music + dancing
Administrative work  +    Special coffee/tea
Laundry folding      +    Call a friend
Waiting rooms        +    Downloaded game
```

### Rules for Temptation Bundling
1. Dopamine source ONLY available during boring task
2. Task must be something you'd do anyway (not excuse to avoid)
3. Dopamine source can't distract from task quality
4. Both must happen together - no cheating

### Weekly Review Questions
1. Which appetizers did I actually use?
2. Did I get at least one main course this week?
3. What dopamine traps did I fall into?
4. What's missing from my menu?
5. What should I try next week?

## Emergency Dopamine Protocol

When you're completely depleted:

```
1. STOP trying to be productive
2. ACKNOWLEDGE: "My brain needs dopamine RIGHT NOW"
3. PICK: One appetizer, do it
4. PICK: Another appetizer, do it
5. PICK: A starter if possible
6. ASSESS: Can I work now? If no, that's okay.
7. LOWER BAR: What's the minimum viable work?
8. DO MINIMUM: Then celebrate it
```

Remember: Dopamine isn't a reward you earn. It's fuel you need. Fill your tank regularly, not just when empty.
