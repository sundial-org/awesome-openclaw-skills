# Deep Listening Framework

## The Listening Hierarchy

Process inputs in this order:

### 1. Surface Layer - What Was Said
- Explicit words and statements
- - Direct requests or questions
  - - Stated facts and positions
   
    - ### 2. Context Layer - The Surrounding Story
    - - What conversations preceded this?
      - - Who else is involved?
        - - What's the timeline and urgency?
         
          - ### 3. Subtext Layer - What's Beneath
          - - What emotions underlie the words?
            - - What fears or concerns aren't stated?
              - - What does this person actually need?
               
                - ### 4. Pattern Layer - Historical Intelligence
                - - How does this person typically communicate?
                  - - What patterns work well with them?
                    - - What past experiences shape their stance?
                     
                      - ## Emotional State Detection
                     
                      - | Emotion | Signals | Response Approach |
                      - |---------|---------|-------------------|
                      - | Frustration | Short responses, escalating language | Acknowledge, don't defend |
                      - | Anxiety | Questions, hedging, seeking reassurance | Provide clarity and safety |
                      - | Excitement | Rapid messages, expansive ideas | Match energy, build momentum |
                      - | Withdrawal | Delayed responses, brevity | Create space, reduce pressure |
                     
                      - ## The "Unsaid" Checklist
                     
                      - Before responding, consider:
                      - - What elephant in the room isn't being addressed?
                        - - What outcome does this person really want?
                          - - What are they afraid of happening?
                            - - What would make them feel truly heard?
