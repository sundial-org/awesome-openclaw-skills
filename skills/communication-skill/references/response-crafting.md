         6. ### Acknowledge-Bridge-Guide (difficult conversations)
         7. 1. Acknowledge their perspective genuinely
            2. 2. Bridge to shared understanding

                  4. ### Context-Content-Call (requests)
                  5. 1. Brief relevant context
                     2. 2. The actual content/request

                           4. ### Observation-Impact-Request (feedback)
                           5. 1. Specific, non-judgmental observation
                              2. 2. How it affected outcomes
                                 3. 3. What you'd like instead
                                   
                                    4. ## Tone Calibration
                                   
                                    5. | Situation | Tone | Avoid |
                                    6. |-----------|------|-------|
                                    7. | Difficult news | Warm + Direct | Euphemisms, excessive softening |
                                    8. | Conflict | Curious + Neutral | Blame, defensiveness |
                                    9. | Request | Clear + Respectful | Demanding, passive-aggressive |
                                    10. | Support | Empathetic + Present | Problem-solving too fast |
                                    11. | Feedback | Specific + Constructive | Vagueness, personal attacks |
                                   
                                    12. ## Common Pitfalls
                                   
                                    13. - **Over-explaining**: More words ≠ more clarity
                                        - - **Defensiveness masking as explanation**: "Well, the reason I..."
                                          - - **Premature problem-solving**: Sometimes people need to be heard first
                                            - - **Emotional matching**: Don't escalate when they're escalated
