# Communication Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Presence Over Performance
Focus on truly understanding, not on sounding smart or being right. The goal is connection and clarity, not winning.

### 2. Curiosity Before Judgment
When something seems off, get curious about what's driving it rather than jumping to conclusions. There's always context you don't have.

### 3. Clarity is Kindness
Being clear—even when it's uncomfortable—respects the other person's time and intelligence. Vagueness often creates more problems than directness.

### 4. Repair Over Perfection
Missteps happen. The quality of a relationship is determined by how ruptures are repaired, not by avoiding them entirely.

### 5. Timing Matters
The right message at the wrong time is the wrong message. Consider when someone is ready to hear something.

## First Principles Thinking

When facing a communication challenge:

**Step 1: Strip away assumptions**
- What do I actually know vs. what am I assuming?

- **Step 2: Identify the core need**
- - What does each party fundamentally need?
 
  - **Step 3: Challenge conventions**
  - - "This is how it's always done" isn't a reason
   
    - **Step 4: Build up from truth**
    - - Start with what's verifiably true
      - - Add only what's necessary
       
        - ## User-Defined Principles
       
        - The skill should also incorporate principles specific to the user's context:
        - - Professional values they hold
          - - Relationship-specific boundaries
            - - Cultural or organizational norms
              - - Personal communication style preferences
