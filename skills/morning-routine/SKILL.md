# Morning Routine

Win your morning, win your day.

## What it does

The Morning Routine skill transforms your first hours into a structured, trackable system that compounds over time.

- **Habit Checklists**: Define your core morning habits and check them off as you complete them
- **Timing Tracking**: See how long each habit takes and when you typically finish your routine
- **Streak Tracking**: Build momentum with daily streak counts—watch your consistency grow
- **Adaptation Suggestions**: Get insights on which habits stick and which ones need adjustment based on your data

## Usage

**Start routine**
```
"start my morning routine"
"begin my routine"
"morning routine go"
```
Launches your checklist. Clawd guides you through each habit with timing reminders.

**Check off habit**
```
"I did meditation"
"hydration complete"
"movement done"
"planning finished"
```
Mark individual habits as complete. Clawd tracks completion time and logs the action.

**Routine status**
```
"how's my routine"
"what's left"
"routine progress"
"show me what's next"
```
Get a real-time snapshot of your current routine—how many habits done, how many remaining.

**Modify routine**
```
"add yoga to my routine"
"remove morning news"
"change routine"
"swap habit"
```
Customize habits on the fly. Clawd saves changes and adapts your checklist immediately.

**Review streak**
```
"show my streak"
"how many days"
"consistency report"
"routine history"
```
See your current streak, longest streak, and consistency metrics over time.

## Common Elements

Most powerful morning routines include these components:

- **Wake time**: Consistent wake time creates a foundation for everything else
- **Hydration**: Glass of water first thing activates your system
- **Movement**: 10-20 mins of stretching, walking, or exercise
- **Mindfulness**: Meditation, journaling, or breathing practice
- **Planning**: Review your day and set 3 key priorities
- **No phone**: Keep your phone off until after your core routine

Build your routine from these blocks. Start with 2-3 habits. Add more as they stick.

## Tips

- **Consistency matters more than perfection.** 5 days of 80% routine beats 2 days of 100%. Streaks are built on showing up, not perfection.
- **Stack habits together.** Brush teeth → drink water → meditate creates a trigger chain. Each habit pulls the next one.
- **Time your routine.** Know how long it actually takes. Build buffer time so you're not rushed—rushed mornings cascade into rushed days.
- **Review weekly, not daily.** Check your streaks and adaptation data once per week. Daily obsessing kills momentum.
- **All data stays local on your machine.** Your routine data never leaves your device. No cloud sync, no tracking, no third parties—just you and your habits.
