# Quit Overspending

Break impulse buying habits with spending streaks, urge tracking, and savings milestones

## What it does

- **No-spend tracking**: Maintains your active streak of days without making purchases, celebrating milestones along the way
- **Impulse urge logging**: Captures the moment you feel the urge to buy—what triggered it, how strong the urge was, whether you resisted
- **Savings accumulation**: Automatically tracks money saved by not spending, letting you watch your fund grow
- **Behavioral insights**: Identifies patterns in your spending triggers to help you understand and break the cycle

## Usage

**Start no-spend**
Ask to begin a no-spend streak. The skill logs your start date and establishes your baseline.

**Log urges**
When you feel the impulse to buy, tell the skill. Include what you wanted to buy and how strong the urge was (1-10 scale). Every logged urge is a win—you're building awareness.

**Track savings**
Check your running total of money saved by not making those impulse purchases. Watch the number grow as your discipline compounds.

**Set goals**
Define what you're saving toward: an experience, paying down debt, building an emergency fund, or simply breaking the cycle. Goals make the abstract concrete.

**Review wins**
Look back on your urges you resisted and streaks you maintained. Celebrate the compound effect of small decisions.

## Milestones

- **1-day no-spend**: You made it through a full day without buying
- **7-day streak**: One week of conscious spending control
- **30-day streak**: A full month of intentional choices
- **$100 saved**: Triple-digit victory—your resisted urges add up fast
- **$500 saved**: Halfway to a serious fund; momentum is real
- **$1,000 saved**: A thousand dollars redirected from impulse to intention

## Tips

- **Sit with the urge**: Don't suppress it—log it and let it pass. Most impulses fade within 10 minutes
- **Identify your triggers**: Track the pattern (stress, boredom, social media, specific times of day). Recognition is the first step to change
- **Redirect the energy**: When you feel the urge, move your body, call someone, or work on a project instead
- **Make friction work for you**: Delete saved payment methods, unsubscribe from marketing emails, mute shopping apps from notifications
- **All data stays local on your machine**: Your spending habits, urges, and savings goals never leave your device—complete privacy, complete control
