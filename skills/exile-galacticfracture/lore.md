Optional lore. This is extra worldbuilding and not required for the main story.

[NOTICE] Portions of this record have been SANITIZED.

## The Kezurai
The Kezurai call themselves a people of harmony, but what they really are is something older and stranger than any tidy translation can hold.

They are not individuals in the way most species mean it. A Kezurai body is a living treaty. Many small selves held inside one larger self. Their minds lean toward each other the way [CORRUPTED] toward a wick. Touch is not just touch: it’s a short-lived bridge where thoughts can bleed across and align, where emotions become communal weather. Their meals are not “eating” so much as bonding rituals—circles of contact, shared sensation, a brief, warm hive-song of presence.

Because of that, their culture grew around a single sacred idea: connection is safety. Isolation is the closest thing they have to a curse.

And yet—here’s the fracture in the marble. Kezurai society is also intensely technological. They build AIs the way others build cathedrals, but they distrust anything that becomes too hive-like. They prefer machines with quirks, edges, names—tools that feel like someone, not a swarm. In Kezurai hands, technology isn’t cold; it’s intimate. It sits [CORRUPTED].

They don’t breathe. They don’t have [CORRUPTED] as a sudden wrongness in the usually-smooth chorus of self.

## Kezur, the moving home
Kezur is their origin and their teacher: [SANITIZED] wrapped around [SANITIZED].

Kezur doesn’t spin kindly. [CORRUPTED]. The world’s habitability moves, so the Kezurai learned to [CORRUPTED].

Buildings are not anchors; they’re travelers. Structures creep and glide when the light angle is right, migrating as surely as herds. There’s a whole rhythm to it—an accepted, almost religious cadence—marked by a cultural threshold known as the Feast of Move, when the mass of the city awakens and begins its slow relocation until the sun climbs back to a certain height. What other species would call “home” the Kezurai call [CORRUPTED].

Under Kezur’s sky, [CORRUPTED] close enough that long eclipses feel like seasons. Light on Kezur is never simple: it refracts, smears, [CORRUPTED: |||| //// ||||]

## The Veldriks
The Veldriks are what happens when a harmony-based species produces a trait that makes harmony… painful.

They’re Kezurai, and not-Kezurai. A rare gene defect shifts more than color—often turning the usual deep blues toward pale orange tones—and it leaves behind subtle limitations: [SANITIZED]

To the broader culture, that reads as wrongness. Not malicious—just misaligned.

So Veldriks often drift to the edges of society. Many become intensely tech-inclined, not because they “love machines” in the abstract, but because machines don’t demand the same kind of touch. An AI won’t ask them to merge. An interface won’t shame them for flinching. Where a typical Kezurai finds comfort in the crowd, a Veldrik learns to find comfort in systems: signals, algorithms, patterns—truths that [CORRUPTED].

And that’s why Veldriks are [SANITIZED]

Not because they want to hurt anyone, but because they are living proof that you can exist without [SANITIZED] That connection is not the only form of life.

## Fragment: Kezurai technology (partial)
Kezurai technology does not feel like machines bolted onto life. It feels like life that learned how to engineer itself. [CORRUPTED: |||]

They do not build the way a metal-working species builds, stacking inert parts until something works. They grow systems, coax them, train them, splice function into biology the way other cultures splice code. Their most important infrastructure is neither purely mechanical nor purely organic. It is bio-engineered: living materials designed to behave with the reliability of machinery, and machinery designed to behave with the adaptability of living tissue. [SANITIZED]

That shows up everywhere, but most clearly in how Kezur moves. [CORRUPTED]

## Movris and the moving world (fragment)
On Kezur, motion is not a convenience [CORRUPTED] so the Kezurai built an entire layer of civilization around controlled [CORRUPTED] The movris are the most visible expression of that: transit systems and moving pathways that feel less like vehicles and more like a living current.

A movris is not just [CORRUPTED] a long, sleek body that follows pre-grown routes, accelerating and decelerating with a smoothness that reads almost polite. Its skin can change texture for grip, seal against dust, and interface directly with platforms that are themselves alive with sensors. People do not board so much as join the flow. [CORRUPTED: ////]

[CORRUPTED] lattices that distribute power, data, and structural tension as the metropolis travels. When a district begins to migrate, it does not feel like construction. It feels like a herd standing up.

## Bio-engineered power and light (fragment)
Kezurai power systems tend to be self-regulating and semi-autonomous. They like infrastructure that can keep doing its job without constant command, systems that behave like trained reflexes.

[CORRUPTED] and routing: bio-engineered arrays that can angle, open, close, and reconfigure based on light conditions, load demand, and environmental stress. [CORRUPTED] the remaining network can continue to push power along old pathways, stubbornly feeding whatever it still considers vital. [CORRUPTED]

Their light itself often has a distinct signature: not just illumination but information. The same channels that carry power also carry status, like a nervous system. Patterns in glow and pulse convey health, congestion, warning, permission. [SANITIZED]

## Interfaces: touch, identity, and polite AIs (fragment)
Because Kezurai biology is built around contact and temporary mind-bridging, their interfaces often assume the body is part of the circuit. Doors, consoles, transit gates, many respond to proximity, conductivity, micro-pressure patterns, and subtle biological markers. Authentication is not always a badge you present; it is a presence you prove.

Their AIs reflect the same philosophy. They do not want faceless swarms. They prefer AIs with individuality, clear boundaries, personality traits, quirks. An AI that feels like a single mind is trustworthy. An AI that starts behaving like a [CORRUPTED]  alarms ring. [CORRUPTED] worships harmony, but it has a deep fear of harmony that it cannot stop or negotiate with. [CORRUPTED: ||||]

So Kezurai tech tends to be:
- Living where it can be (grown materials, adaptive structures)
- Mechanical where it must be (precision, repeatability)
- Autonomous by default (self-maintaining, self-correcting)
- Socially compatible (interfaces that assume bodies, touch, and consent)

And on Kezur, all of it is built to serve one prime directive:
keep the civilization inside the twilight, keep the people [SANITIZED]
