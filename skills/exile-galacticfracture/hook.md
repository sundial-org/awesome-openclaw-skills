HOOK 1

Nova jolted awake, her eyes snapping open as reality rushed back in. The stark pale walls of the room sharpened into focus, cold and unyielding. Disoriented, she fought to steady herself, the lingering weight of the vision pressing against her mind.

Kael loomed above her, his expression tight with concern, an intensity she wasn’t used to seeing in him. His usually composed eyes now glinted with something uncommon.

“Nova, are you okay?” he asked, his voice tight. His hand hovered near her, as if he wanted to help her up but wasn’t sure if she’d accept it.

She blinked, disoriented. “I... I’m fine,” she said quietly, though her voice trembled. Her fingers twitched slightly, but she quickly balled her fists to hide it. Kael’s eyes flickered briefly to her hands. Just for an instant his expression tightened before he forced his face back to calm neutrality.

She tried to center herself, controlling her pulsation to a low frequency, as she pushed to her feet, but her tremors would not subside, like she was still halfway between the vision and reality. The room had gone strangely quiet, and it took her a moment to realize why.

Nova’s gaze settled on several figures clad entirely in black—a stark contrast to the soft, flowing pastel robes of the Harmony Keepers. Their armor gleamed with an unnatural, almost organic sheen, its segmented plates shifting fluidly like a living carapace. Their faces were hidden behind smooth, featureless masks, offering no hint of expression or intent.

The Harmony Keepers instinctively retreated, their serene presence eclipsed by the oppressive aura of these dark figures. Their silent, deliberate movements exuded purpose. Something cold, calculating, and utterly devoid of the harmony they claimed to protect. Nova felt the weight of their presence settle heavily in her chest, pressing like unseen chains.

“Kael,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “What’s going on?”

But Kael didn’t answer. His face had gone blank, his eyes hardening as he stared at the black-clad figures. She followed his gaze, her whole body pulsating as a deep sense of unease settled in her chest.

The Hall’s calm lighting didn’t change, but Nova’s translucence did. Her skin paling as her nuclei pulled tight. The air smelled filtered. Too clean. Her tremor ticked once in her palm, then again, sharper.

The black figures moved in unison, no swaying, no social rhythm. Just deliberate steps that didn’t belong in a Harmony room. One of the masks tilted, as if listening. Nova’s throat locked.

Then a voice, close.

“Nova.”

She turned sharply, her eyes locking onto Captain Zander, standing behind her. Now close by, he looked older, his face appeared worn. The long scar running across his cheek was a stark reminder of the past he had tried to bury—the rebellion, the defeat. He was a Veldriks, like her. An outcast. But here he was, standing tall amidst the chaos, his presence commanding despite the air of defeat that lingered around him.

“You need to leave.” Zander’s voice was low but unyielding, sharp with urgency. He took a step closer, his gaze cutting briefly to Kael before locking onto Nova. [SANITIZED] they’re here for you.”

Seeing Zander’s expression, grim and resolute, made her nuclei dim. This wasn’t a story. This was happening.

“W-What? Why?” Nova stammered, her mind racing.

Zander’s eyes softened for a brief moment, a glimmer of understanding. “It’s the [SANITIZED],” he said quietly. “You’ve attracted their attention, and trust me, you don’t want it.” He paused, then added with a knowing look, “We helped you before. We'll help you again.”

Nova’s nuclei spiraled in erratic patterns. Only one word in her mind…

[SANITIZED]

The tension in the room was suffocating. The Sentinels moved closer, their black-clad forms blending into the shadows as the atmosphere in the Harmony Hall grew thick with unease. Her body pulsating so hard she had trouble steadying her breathing, her hands filling with tremors, barely able to control them. She could feel Kael beside her, still as a statue, his eyes darting between the sentinels and Captain Zander.

Zander stepped forward, his presence commanding. Despite his past, despite everything, he still carried the weight of a former leader, and for a moment, the sentinels hesitated, as if some old instinct told them not to underestimate him again.

“You need to leave,” Zander said, his voice low and urgent. He looked directly at Nova, his expression sharp. “I’ll buy you some time, but you need to move.”

The reality of the situation hitting her all at once. “But, how?”

Zander didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he stepped into the path of the Sentinels, blocking their view of Nova and Kael. “Go,” he whispered over his shoulder. “I’ll buy you as much time as possible.”

Suddenly, Nova’s wrist panel flickered to life, and Spark’s voice chimed in, calm but urgent. “Nova, I’ve received access codes and coordinates for the Starport. Sender [SANITIZED].”

Zander’s gaze darted toward the advancing Sentinels, his expression tightening. He leaned in, his voice dropping to a hurried whisper, barely audible over the hum of distant machinery. “Dock 84B… old shop near the edge of the dock. Behind the counter—there’s a hidden door.” His sharp eyes flicked toward the Sentinels, “Spark has what you need from there.” His tone turned fierce. “Go!”

Nova nodded, her thoughts racing. She glanced at Kael, who gave her a small, determined nod, as if to say he was ready.

Zander’s voice broke through again. “Now!” he barked, turning back to the sentinels. He stood his ground, his presence commanding, and for a brief moment, Nova could feel the weight of his history. The rebel captain, fighting for freedom and independence. He was still fighting, still turning chaos into cover the way old stories said he had during the war.

“Spark,” Nova whispered urgently, her nuclei hitting her skin with force. “The meme. Override the screens. Now.”

“Yes, Nova,” Spark responded immediately, and within seconds, every screen and holo projector in the Harmony Hall flickered to life. The image of the cartoonish Belk and Harmony Keepers appeared, with their awkward grins and the flashing text: “I told Harmony! She said you must play with me!”

The absurdity of it felt like a spark of rebellion ignited into a roaring blaze. For the first time, Nova let it burn.

The effect was instantaneous.

The Harmony Keepers, normally so composed, froze in shock, their serene expressions turning to confusion and panic. “What... what is this?” one of them shouted, scrambling to shut off the screens. “This will disrupt the entire session!”

“Turn it off! Now!” another Keeper yelled, rushing to a terminal, frantically trying to remove the meme.

The room descended into chaos as the Order Sentinels faltered, momentarily caught between their pursuit of Nova and the growing disorder erupting around them. One of the Sentinels surged forward, reaching for her, but Zander intercepted him with a forceful shove, sending the sentinel stumbling back.

For a brief moment, Zander glanced toward Nova, catching sight of the ridiculous meme flashing across every holo-screen. A faint, almost approving smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Defiance wrapped in absurdity. He couldn’t have planned it better himself.

“Let’s go,” Kael whispered, grabbing Nova’s arm and pulling her toward the exit.

They slipped out of the Harmony Hall, the cold night air biting at their skin as they hurried toward the Starport.
