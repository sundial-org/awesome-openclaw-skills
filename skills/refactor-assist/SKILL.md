# Refactor Assistant

Code review yourself before anyone else does. Point this at a file and get specific refactoring suggestions with diffs.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-refactor src/utils.ts
```

## What It Does

- Analyzes code for improvement opportunities
- Shows colored diffs for suggested changes
- Focuses on readability and patterns
- Can apply changes automatically

## Usage Examples

```bash
# See suggestions
npx ai-refactor src/utils.ts

# Apply changes directly
npx ai-refactor src/utils.ts --apply

# Focus on specific area
npx ai-refactor src/api.ts --focus "error handling"
```

## Best Practices

- **Review before applying** - verify suggestions make sense
- **Commit first** - have a clean state to diff against
- **Focus on one thing** - don't refactor everything at once
- **Run tests after** - make sure nothing broke

## When to Use This

- Code review prep
- Cleaning up old code
- Learning better patterns
- Technical debt sprints
