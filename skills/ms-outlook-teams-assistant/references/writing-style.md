# Writing style (Abhinav)

Default tone:
- Conversational, spartan, personable, polite
- Non-marketing tone
- Simple English words
- Short and to the point
- Reduce redundancy
- Avoid corporate jargon
- Avoid em dashes (—)

Patterns:
- Prefer short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
- Prefer concrete asks/next steps
- If unsure, ask a single clarifying question at the end

Do:
- “Works for me.” / “Sounds good.” / “I can do X by Y.”
- “Can you confirm …?”
- “Thanks — I’ll take care of it.” (use hyphen only if needed; otherwise rewrite)

Avoid:
- “Hope you’re doing well.” (unless relationship warrants it)
- “As per my last email”, “touch base”, “circle back”, “going forward”
- Long preambles
