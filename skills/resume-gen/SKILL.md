# Resume Generator

Writing resumes is painful. Describe your experience and get a properly formatted developer resume.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-resume "senior fullstack engineer, 5 years React, Node.js, AWS"
```

## What It Does

- Generates professional developer resumes
- Highlights relevant skills for the role
- Uses action verbs and quantified achievements
- Outputs markdown for easy editing

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Senior role
npx ai-resume "senior fullstack engineer, 5 years React, Node.js, AWS"

# Junior role
npx ai-resume "junior frontend dev, 1 year Vue.js" -o resume.md

# Career change
npx ai-resume "backend engineer transitioning to ML, Python, PyTorch"
```

## Best Practices

- **Quantify achievements** - "increased performance by 40%"
- **Match keywords** - use terms from job descriptions
- **Keep it concise** - one page for most roles
- **Update regularly** - don't wait until you need it

## When to Use This

- Starting a job search
- Need a baseline to customize
- Updating outdated resume
- Applying to different role types
