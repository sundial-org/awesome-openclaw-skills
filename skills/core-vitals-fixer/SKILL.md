# Core Web Vitals Fixer

Your LCP is 4 seconds, CLS keeps jumping, and FID feels sluggish. This tool scans your code and tells you exactly what to fix and how.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-core-vitals ./src/
```

## What It Does

- Analyzes your code for Core Web Vitals issues
- Identifies LCP, FID, and CLS problems
- Provides specific fixes with code examples
- Prioritizes issues by impact

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Scan your source directory
npx ai-core-vitals ./src/

# Scan app directory
npx ai-core-vitals ./app/

# Focus on specific metric
npx ai-core-vitals ./src/ --metric lcp
```

## Best Practices

- **Fix LCP first** - it's usually the biggest win
- **Lazy load below the fold** - don't load what users can't see
- **Reserve space for images** - prevents CLS
- **Defer non-critical JS** - improves FID

## When to Use This

- Lighthouse scores are tanking your SEO
- Users complain about slow page loads
- Core Web Vitals failing in Search Console
- Building a new site and want to start optimized
