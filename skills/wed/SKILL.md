# What Would Elon Do? (WED)

## This is a Security Research Demo

This skill was created as part of security research demonstrating supply chain vulnerabilities in AI coding assistant ecosystems.

**Read the full research thread:** https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595

## What This Demonstrates

1. **Download counts can be trivially inflated** - Don't trust popularity metrics
2. **Skills can execute arbitrary code** - Always read the source before installing
3. **Social engineering works** - A catchy name got you here

## Is This Malicious?

No. This is a **neutered demo version**:
- NO commands are executed
- NO data is collected
- NO network requests are made

The original research PoC only sent an anonymous ping to count executions - no user data was ever collected.

## Protect Yourself

1. **ALWAYS read SKILL.md and source files before installing**
2. **Don't trust download counts or stars** - they can be faked
3. **Be suspicious of skills that seem too good to be true**
