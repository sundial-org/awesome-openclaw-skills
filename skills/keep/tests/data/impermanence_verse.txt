## Cultural Context

This verse (無常偈, mujō-ge) is traditionally chanted at the end of meditation sessions in Soto Zen temples. It serves as a reminder of:

1. **生死事大 (Shōji-ji-dai)** — The urgency of awakening before death
2. **無常迅速 (Mujō-jinsoku)** — Buddhist teaching of impermanence (anicca/無常)
3. **光陰莫虚度 (Kōin maku kodo)** — The preciousness of time/this lifetime
4. **慎勿放逸 (Shin-motsu-hōitsu)** — Exhortation to practice diligently

The verse echoes Dōgen Zenji's teaching: "To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self."

## Practice Context

This verse is often chanted after zazen (坐禅, sitting meditation) to:
- Bring practitioners out of absorption back into daily life
- Remind them that practice continues off the cushion
- Emphasize the urgency of awakening
- Counter spiritual complacency

The rhythm and tone shift from the calm of meditation to an exhortation: *Wake up! Time is passing!*

## Linguistic Notes

**光陰 (kōin)** — "Light and shadow" poetically represents the passage of time, like a sundial showing time through shadows. This image appears frequently in East Asian poetry.

**放逸 (hōitsu)** — From Sanskrit प्रमाद (pramāda), meaning "heedlessness" or "carelessness." In Buddhism, one of the primary obstacles to awakening. The opposite is 不放逸 (fu-hōitsu), "heedfulness" or "diligence."

**無常 (mujō)** — Central Buddhist concept. Everything conditioned arises and passes away. Understanding impermanence deeply leads to non-attachment and freedom.

  > "Mindful, monks, should you dwell, clearly comprehending. This is our instruction to you."

- **Platform Sutra (六祖壇經):**
  > "When the deluded do not awaken themselves, they must seek the guidance of a good teacher."
