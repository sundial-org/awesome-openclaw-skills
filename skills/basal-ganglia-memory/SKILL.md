# Basal Ganglia Memory 🎯

**Habit formation for AI agents.** Part of the AI Brain series.

## Status: 🚧 Under Development

This skill is being developed. Star/watch for updates!

## Concept

The basal ganglia is responsible for habit formation and procedural learning. This skill will give AI agents:

- **Habit tracking** — actions repeated become automatic preferences
- **Procedural memory** — "muscle memory" for common workflows
- **Reward-based learning** — reinforce patterns that work
- **Preference development** — "I always do X this way because it works"

## AI Brain Series

| Part | Function | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| [hippocampus](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/hippocampus) | Memory formation, decay, reinforcement | ✅ Live |
| [amygdala-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/amygdala-memory) | Emotional processing | ✅ Live |
| **basal-ganglia-memory** | Habit formation | 🚧 Development |
| [anterior-cingulate-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/anterior-cingulate-memory) | Conflict detection | 🚧 Development |
| [insula-memory](https://www.clawhub.ai/skills/insula-memory) | Internal state awareness | 🚧 Development |

## Coming Soon

Based on neuroscience research on the basal ganglia's role in procedural learning and habit formation.
