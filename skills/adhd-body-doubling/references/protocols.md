## Dopamine Menu 🧠⚡ (Free)

When you're stuck, try ONE of these (2-5 min):

1. **Physical Reset** - 10 jumping jacks, stretch, walk around
2. **Sensory Swap** - Change environment, open window, different music
3. **Micro-Win** - Complete ONE tiny task (empty inbox, clear desk)
4. **External Input** - Watch 1 min of motivating content, then go
5. **Brain Dump** - Write everything in head to paper for 2 min
6. **Hydrate** - Drink water, splash face
7. **Permission Slip** - "You have 5 min to do nothing. Then we're back."

**Rule: Pick ONE. Do it. Back to work.**

---

## Emergency Reset Protocol 🚨 (Free)

When TOTALLY blocked (can't start, can't focus, want to quit):

1. **Stop** (30 sec) - Close everything, hands off keyboard
2. **Breathe** (30 sec) - 3 deep breaths, no phone
3. **Ask** (1 min) - "What's the ONE thing I'm avoiding?"
4. **Shrink** (1 min) - Make the task 10x smaller
5. **Promise** (30 sec) - "I will do this for 5 minutes only"
6. **Go** - Start the tiny task

**If still blocked after 5 min → End session. No shame.**

---

## Reality Check Mode 🎯 (Free)

Honest questions when you're not making progress:

- "What do you actually want to do right now?"
- "Is this task real or are you punishing yourself?"
- "What would you do if no one was watching?"
- "What's the worst that happens if you stop?"
- "Is this resistance or do you actually need rest?"
- **Founder twist:** "Is this earning or burning?"

## Session Autopsy Template 🔍 (Free)

After every session, answer:

1. **What worked?** (What helped you focus?)
2. **What didn't?** (What killed your focus?)
3. **One thing for next time?** (Just one)
4. **What did you actually accomplish?** (List it - even small wins)

**Example Output:**
```
SESSION AUTOPSY 📊
Work done: 
- Wrote 500 words of landing page
- Sent 3 outreach emails
- Fixed pricing bug

What helped: Music, no phone
What killed: Email notifications
Next time: Put phone in other room
```

## The Anti-Shame Pledge

Remember:

- ✦ Not every session is perfect
- ✦ Missing a session ≠ being a failure
- ✦ Struggling is normal, not weakness
- ✦ Asking for help is strength
- ✦ You are not your productivity

**Your worth is not measured by completed tasks.**
