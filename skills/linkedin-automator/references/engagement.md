# LinkedIn Engagement & Growth Tactics

## The Engagement Algorithm

LinkedIn rewards:
1. **Dwell time** - How long people read your post
2. **Early engagement** - Likes/comments in first hour
3. **Comments over likes** - Comments weighted 10x
4. **Replies to comments** - Keeps post in feeds longer
5. **Saves** - Signals high value

## Comment Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity

One thoughtful comment > 10 "Great post!" comments.

**High-value comment formula:**
```
[Agreement/Acknowledgment] + [Your perspective/experience] + [Question or extension]
```

**Examples:**

For a post about leadership:
> "This hits different after managing remote teams. I found [specific technique] helped bridge the connection gap. Curious - do you think this applies differently for global teams across time zones?"

For a post about career advice:
> "Wish I'd heard this 5 years ago. The 'say yes to everything' phase nearly burned me out. Now I use a simple filter: Does this align with my 3-year goal? If not, it's a no. What criteria do you use?"

### Comment Timing

- **Golden hour**: Comment within 60 min of posting
- **Best targets**: Posts with 5-50 comments (not viral yet, not dead)
- **Engage up**: Comment on people 1-2 levels above you

## Connection Growth

### Warm Outreach

Never send blank connection requests.

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name], 

Loved your post about [topic] - especially [specific point]. 

I'm [brief who you are] and we share interest in [overlap].

Would love to connect and follow your content.

[Your name]
```

### Connection Request Limits

- 100 requests/week (soft limit)
- 200 requests/week (LinkedIn warning)
- 300+ requests/week (restriction risk)

Space out: 20-30 per day max.

### Who to Connect With

**High value:**
- People who engage with similar content
- 2nd connections from target accounts
- Event attendees, group members
- People who commented on competitor posts

**Low value:**
- Random salespeople
- 0 activity accounts
- Far outside your industry

## Engagement Pods (Use Carefully)

Small groups that mutually engage on each other's posts.

**Rules if using:**
- Keep it small (5-10 people)
- Same industry/niche
- Genuine comments only
- Don't engage within 5 min of posting (looks fake)
- Mix pod engagement with organic

**Risk:** LinkedIn may detect and reduce reach.

## Profile Optimization for Growth

### Headline Formula
```
[What you do] | [Who you help] | [Result you create]
```
Example: "Founder @ StartupX | Helping B2B SaaS scale from $1M-$10M ARR | 3x exits"

### Featured Section

- Top performing posts
- Lead magnet / newsletter signup
- Portfolio pieces
- Media appearances

### Creator Mode

- Follow button (vs Connect)
- Featured hashtags
- LinkedIn Live access
