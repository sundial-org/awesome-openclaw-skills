# Image Optimizer

Your images are 5MB each and nobody noticed until Lighthouse screamed. This tool scans your images and tells you exactly what to optimize.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-image-optimize ./public/images/
```

## What It Does

- Scans image directories for optimization opportunities
- Identifies oversized images
- Suggests format conversions (PNG to WebP, etc.)
- Recommends responsive image strategies

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Scan images directory
npx ai-image-optimize ./public/images/

# Scan assets folder
npx ai-image-optimize ./assets/

# Get detailed report
npx ai-image-optimize ./public/ --verbose
```

## Best Practices

- **Use WebP** - smaller than PNG/JPEG with same quality
- **Serve responsive images** - don't send desktop images to mobile
- **Lazy load below the fold** - defer loading offscreen images
- **Compress aggressively** - 80% quality is usually fine

## When to Use This

- Lighthouse says images are too big
- Page load times are slow
- Want to audit image usage
- Planning an optimization sprint
