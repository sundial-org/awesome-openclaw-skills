# Weight Loss

Sustainable progress tracking for your health journey—data stays local, accountability stays real.

## What it does

- **Log weigh-ins** - Record daily or weekly measurements without judgment
- **Trend smoothing** - See the big picture past daily fluctuations
- **Goal tracking** - Set realistic targets and watch milestones unfold
- **Non-scale victories** - Celebrate strength gains, energy boosts, and clothes fitting better
- **Privacy-first** - All data lives on your machine, never uploaded or shared

## Usage

### Log Weight
Simply tell Clawd your weight: *"Log 185 pounds"* or *"Weigh-in: 82.5 kg"*. Include the date or use today's date by default.

### Check Progress
Ask for a snapshot: *"How much weight have I lost?"* or *"Show me my last 4 weeks of weigh-ins"*. Get totals, averages, and velocity.

### Set Goal
Define your target: *"My goal weight is 170 pounds"* or *"I want to lose 25 pounds in 6 months"*. Clawd calculates the weekly pace needed.

### View Trends
Visualize your journey: *"Plot my weight trend"* or *"Show me month-over-month progress"*. Smoothed curves reveal the real direction underneath daily noise.

### Non-Scale Wins
Log what matters beyond the scale: *"Record NSV: ran a 5K without stopping"* or *"Clothes fit better, went down a size"*. These compound motivation.

## Milestones

- **First 5 lbs** - Momentum builds. Metabolism responds. You're doing this.
- **10 lbs lost** - Visible shift. People notice. You feel lighter.
- **10% body weight** - Science milestone. Real metabolic and health gains.
- **Halfway to goal** - You've proven you can do this. Finish is in sight.
- **Goal reached** - Celebration earned. Now: how do you stay here?

## Tips

1. **Weigh yourself consistently** - Same time, same scale, same conditions (morning, after bathroom, before eating). Consistency matters more than perfection.

2. **Weekly averages, not daily obsession** - Weight fluctuates 3-5 lbs daily from water, food volume, hormones. Track weekly averages to see real trends.

3. **Sustainable beats extreme** - 0.5-1 lb per week is healthy and actually sticks. 3 lb weeks crash. Slow compound wins.

4. **Non-scale progress is real** - Energy, strength, sleep, mood, clothes fit, bloodwork—these outlead the scale. Track them.

5. **All data stays local on your machine** - Your weight history lives only where you choose. No cloud uploads, no corporate databases, no data brokers. Privacy is default.
