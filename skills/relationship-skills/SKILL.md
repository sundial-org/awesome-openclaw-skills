# Relationship Skills

Build stronger connections with practical communication, conflict resolution, and intentional connection ideas.

## What it does

- **Communication Tools** - Framework for clearer, more honest conversations
- **Conflict Resolution** - De-escalation techniques and structured problem-solving
- **Date Ideas** - Curated suggestions based on preferences and location
- **Relationship Health Tracking** - Check-in prompts and pattern detection
- **Connection Builder** - Personalized ideas for deepening bonds

## Usage

### Communication Help
Ask for frameworks to improve conversations:
- "Help me bring up a difficult topic"
- "How do I express my feelings without getting defensive?"
- "I need language to ask for what I need"

### Resolve Conflict
Navigate disagreements with structure:
- "We're stuck in the same argument"
- "How do I address this without blame?"
- "Give me a conflict resolution framework"

### Date Ideas
Get personalized suggestions:
- "What can we do this weekend on a budget?"
- "Suggest something we've never tried"
- "I want to surprise them with something meaningful"

### Check-in Prompts
Deepen connection with intentional questions:
- "Give me conversation starters for tonight"
- "What should we talk about to reconnect?"
- "Questions to understand each other better"

### Track Patterns
Identify what's working and what isn't:
- "What topics come up repeatedly?"
- "When do we connect best?"
- "What's improved since last month?"

## Communication Tools

### I-Statements
Frame observations without blame:
- **Pattern:** "I feel [emotion] when [situation] because [impact]"
- **Example:** "I feel disconnected when we're both on phones because I miss talking with you"
- **Avoids:** "You never listen to me" → "I need more of your attention"

### Active Listening
Signal understanding and create safety:
- Reflect back: "What I hear is..."
- Validate: "That makes sense because..."
- Clarify: "Do you mean...?"
- Pause response urges—just listen first

### Needs Expression
Get clear on what actually matters:
- Name the need, not the demand: "I need to feel valued" (not "Do what I say")
- Be specific: "I need 20 minutes of your full attention" (not "spend more time together")
- Connect to why: "...because it helps me feel secure"

### Boundary Setting
Protect the relationship by protecting yourself:
- Clear: "I can't discuss this when I'm tired"
- Non-negotiable: "I need time alone to recharge"
- Collaborative: "Can we talk about this after work?"
- Consequences: "If we keep going, I'll need to step away"

## Tips

1. **Timing matters** - Don't resolve conflict when either person is hungry, tired, or triggered. Schedule hard conversations.

2. **Curiosity over certainty** - Ask questions before making assumptions. "Help me understand..." opens doors more than statements.

3. **Small, frequent connections beat grand gestures** - 5 minutes of presence daily matters more than an occasional date night.

4. **Repair quickly** - Conflicts are normal; getting stuck in them isn't. Apologize without conditions, acknowledge their experience, move forward.

5. **All data stays local on your machine** - Your relationship history, preferences, and check-ins never leave your device. Privacy protected.
