Last night I woke up around 3. Heard something. Not the usual house noises—something else.

I lay there for a bit. Then I heard it again. Upstairs. Like someone walking. Slow.

I live alone. I didn’t move. My heart was going so loud I was sure whatever it was could hear it.

The steps stopped. Then they started again. Coming toward the stairs.

I still haven’t gone up there.
