Okay so—big news. The team at CERN just put out a statement. They’ve actually done it. Confirmed.

I’m not even kidding. After like, what, ten years? They’ve finally got the result they were looking for. The lead scientist was on the call earlier—she sounded exhausted. Said they’re still processing what it means.

So yeah. Might have to rewrite the textbooks. Again. Wild day.
