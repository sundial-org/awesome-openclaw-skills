# Roast Gen

Want honest feedback on your code? This tool roasts it. Points out the bad patterns, the lazy shortcuts, the "what were you thinking" moments. But unlike mean code reviewers, it's funny about it. And it gives you actual fixes.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-roast ./src/app.ts
```

## What It Does

- Analyzes your code and finds everything wrong with it
- Delivers feedback with humor instead of corporate speak
- Points out anti-patterns, code smells, and questionable decisions
- Provides actual fixes for each roast
- Rates your code on a scale of "production ready" to "how is this running"

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Roast a single file
npx ai-roast ./src/checkout.ts

# Roast your entire codebase (brave)
npx ai-roast ./src/

# Get a gentle roast
npx ai-roast ./src/utils.ts --level mild

# Full savage mode
npx ai-roast ./src/legacy.js --level brutal
```

## Best Practices

- **Don't take it personally** - The roast is about the code, not you
- **Start with mild** - Build up your tolerance before going brutal
- **Share with your team** - Group roasts are team bonding
- **Actually fix the issues** - The jokes are fun but the fixes are the point

## When to Use This

- You want code review feedback but don't want to bother a coworker
- Team retro and you want to laugh at your tech debt
- Onboarding new devs and want to show them what not to do
- You're confident your code is good and want to be humbled
