# The Amazing Benefits of Typing Very Fast

About a year ago I decided I wanted to become a faster typer as I spend most of my day on a computer and thought it might have an impact on how fast I could work. I decided to practice on Monkeytype.com every day for at least 10 mins. I started out around 80 WPM and about 2 weeks in I was already over 100. A year in and I've hit 150. The impact on my daily workflows has been incredible. I'm about at the speed where I can type at the speed of my thinking, which is great for writing copy. 

### Getting Started

To start, I used Monkeytype.com and decided to commit at least 5 to 10 minutes every day to practice. I started at around 80 WPM, which was decent, but I really didn't expect to improve as quickly as I did.

Within 2 to 3 weeks of daily practice, my speed jumped to over 100 WPM. This rapid improvement served as a great morale boost, prompting me to stick with my practice regime. A little under a year later, I was able to clock a 150 WPM!

### The Impact on Daily Workflows

The impact of my newfound typing speed on my daily workflows was phenomenal. As someone who works in front of a computer all-day everyday, the ability to type at the same speed as my thinking proved to be a game-changer, particularly when it came to writing copy. It was amazing how quickly I could get my ideas on the computer screen.

I discovered that the benefits of being a fast typer extend beyond simple time-saving. It's akin to unlocking a new level of proficiency on your computer, and the advantages are more numerous than you might expect.

### Why You Should Consider Typing Faster

If you're at all like me, it will quickly become like a sport where you're constantly trying to improve your previous WPM. The beauty of this skill is that the barriers to entry are virtually non-existent. If you can type, you can improve. All it requires is a little dedication, with just 5-10 minutes of practice per day.

### Taking Workflows to the Next Level by Typing Faster

For Mac users that leverage a spotlight replacement app like Alfred or Raycast, typing faster can revolutionize your daily workflows. I use Raycast personally, and the simple act of pressing cmd+space and quickly typing the app I need to open or file I need to search become nearly instantaneous. Whether it's opening apps or performing functions, everything seems to be accomplished at warp speed.

Even if you only use the basic spotlight feature on your Mac, you'll certainly see a substantial increase in your speed of navigation. Suddenly, finding what you're looking for becomes a swift, almost instantaneous process.

### Conclusion

As we further immerse ourselves in our digital era, being a fast typer is no longer just a party trick. It's a practical skill, one that can help you navigate your digital world more efficiently and productively.

My journey towards becoming a faster typer proved to be one of the most impactful things I've done to get more done. It took a tool I use every day — my keyboard — and turned it into a vehicle for productivity and efficiency.

If you find yourself tethered to a keyboard for a significant part of your day, consider investing a few minutes each day towards improving your typing speed. You will certainly be surprised by the boost in productivity, how much quicker you can communicate and collaborate with your team. So, how about giving it a shot and seeing where it takes you?
