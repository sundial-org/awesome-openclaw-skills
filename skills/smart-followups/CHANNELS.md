## Channel Detection Logic

The handler automatically detects the channel and formats appropriately:

```javascript
// Channels with button support
const BUTTON_CHANNELS = ['telegram', 'discord', 'slack'];

// Check channel capability
function supportsButtons(channel, capabilities) {
  return BUTTON_CHANNELS.includes(channel) && 
         capabilities?.includes('inlineButtons');
}
```

**Priority:**
1. Check if channel is in `BUTTON_CHANNELS` list
2. Verify `inlineButtons` capability is enabled
3. Fall back to text mode if either check fails

---

## Configuration Per Channel

You can override settings per channel in `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "channels": {
        "telegram": {
          "mode": "buttons",
          "showCategory": true
        },
        "signal": {
          "mode": "text",
          "compact": false
        },
        "sms": {
          "mode": "text",
          "compact": true,
          "stripEmoji": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | auto | `buttons`, `text`, or `auto` |
| `compact` | false | Use compact formatting |
| `showCategory` | true | Show category labels (⚡🧠🔗) |
| `stripEmoji` | false | Remove emojis (for SMS) |

## Reply Handling

### Button Channels

When a user clicks a button:
1. Button sends `callback_data` containing the question
2. OpenClaw receives it as a new user message
3. OpenClaw answers the question normally

### Text Channels

When a user replies with a number:
1. OpenClaw receives "1", "2", or "3"
2. Handler maps number to the corresponding question
3. OpenClaw processes as if user typed the full question

**Implementation Note:** The handler stores recent suggestions in session context to map numbers back to questions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Buttons not appearing on Telegram

1. Check channel config has `capabilities: ["inlineButtons"]`
2. Verify bot has inline button permissions
3. Try restarting OpenClaw

### Numbers not working on Signal

1. Make sure you're replying with just the number (1, 2, or 3)
2. Don't include other text
3. Check OpenClaw logs for errors

### Wrong formatting on WhatsApp

WhatsApp formatting is limited. If buttons don't work:
1. Check if you have a WhatsApp Business account
2. The skill defaults to text mode for reliability

### Emojis broken on SMS

Some carriers strip emojis. Enable `stripEmoji: true` in SMS channel config:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "channels": {
        "sms": {
          "stripEmoji": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding New Channels

To add support for a new channel:

1. **Check button support** — Does the platform support interactive buttons?
2. **Add to handler** — Update `BUTTON_CHANNELS` array if supported
3. **Test formatting** — Verify text/button output looks correct
4. **Document** — Add section to this file

Pull requests welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
