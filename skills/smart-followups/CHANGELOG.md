- **Documentation**
  - README.md: Feature overview and quick start
  - SKILL.md: Comprehensive OpenClaw integration guide
  - examples.md: Channel-specific output examples
  - INTERNAL.md: Architecture and design decisions
  - QUICKSTART.md: 5-minute setup guide

- **Features**
  - 3 contextual suggestions per generation (1 per category)
  - 3 categories: Quick (⚡), Deep Dive (🧠), Related (🔗)
  - Mobile-optimized UI (3 buttons = no scrolling on Telegram)
  - Context-aware analysis of last 1-3 exchanges
  - Sub-second latency with Claude Haiku
  - Cost-effective (~$0.0001 per generation)

#### Technical Details
- Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` v0.32.0
- Node.js 18+ required
- Temperature: 0.7 for optimal diversity

#### Design Decisions
- **3 suggestions (not 6)**: Mobile UX testing showed 3 buttons are cleaner and less cluttered on Telegram mobile, reducing decision fatigue while maintaining category diversity
