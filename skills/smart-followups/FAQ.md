# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Smart Follow-ups?

A OpenClaw skill that generates contextual follow-up suggestions after AI responses. It analyzes your recent conversation and suggests 3 relevant questions across three categories:

- ⚡ **Quick** — Clarifications, definitions, immediate next steps
- 🧠 **Deep Dive** — Technical depth, advanced concepts, thorough exploration
- 🔗 **Related** — Connected topics, broader context, alternative perspectives

### Why only 3 suggestions?

We originally planned 6 (2 per category), but found 3 provides a cleaner UX:
- Less overwhelming, especially on mobile
- Each category gets one focused, high-quality suggestion
- Faster to scan and decide
- Keeps the interface clean

### How do I use it?

Type `/followups` in any OpenClaw conversation. On Telegram/Discord/Slack, you'll see 3 clickable buttons. On Signal/iMessage, you'll see a numbered list — reply with 1, 2, or 3.

## Authentication & Providers

### What's the default authentication method?

**OpenClaw native** — the skill uses your existing OpenClaw authentication (Claude CLI token login). No additional API keys required.

### Can I use OpenRouter instead?

Yes! Set `provider: "openrouter"` in your config and provide your OpenRouter API key:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Can I use direct Anthropic API?

Yes! Set `provider: "anthropic"` with your Anthropic API key:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "apiKey": "sk-ant-..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Which model does it use?

- **OpenClaw native:** Uses your current session's model (if you're chatting with Opus, follow-ups use Opus)
- **OpenRouter/Anthropic:** Defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.5, configurable via `model` setting

### Can I force a specific model?

Yes, set the `model` option:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
    }
  }
}
```

## Privacy & Security

### Is my conversation data sent anywhere?

**With OpenClaw native (default):** Same privacy as your normal chat. Your recent exchanges are processed by your configured AI provider (Anthropic) using your existing authentication.

**With OpenRouter:** Your recent exchanges are sent to OpenRouter's API. See [OpenRouter's privacy policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

**With direct Anthropic:** Your recent exchanges are sent to Anthropic's API. See [Anthropic's privacy policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy).

### How much context is sent?

Only the last 1-3 message exchanges (user + assistant pairs). We don't send your entire conversation history.

### Are the suggestions logged anywhere?

No. Suggestions are generated on-demand and returned directly to you. Nothing is stored by the skill.

## Cost

### How much does it cost to use?

- **OpenClaw native:** Part of your normal API usage, no additional cost structure
- **OpenRouter:** ~$0.001-0.01 per generation depending on model
- **Direct Anthropic:** ~$0.001-0.01 per generation depending on model

For reference, using Claude Haiku costs ~$0.0002 per generation. Claude Sonnet costs ~$0.003-0.01.

### Can I use a cheaper model for follow-ups?

Yes! Even if your main chat uses Opus, you can configure follow-ups to use Haiku:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
      "apiKey": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### /followups doesn't work

1. **Check skill is installed:** `ls /path/to/openclaw/skills/smart-followups/`
2. **Check skill is enabled:** Look for `smart-followups` in your `openclaw.json`
3. **Restart OpenClaw:** After installing or configuring skills

### "API key required" error

You're using OpenRouter or Anthropic provider but haven't set an API key. Either:
- Switch to `provider: "openclaw"` (uses existing auth)
- Add your API key to the config

### Suggestions aren't relevant

The skill analyzes your last 1-3 exchanges. If your conversation is very short or vague, suggestions may be generic. Try having a more detailed exchange first.

### Buttons don't appear on Telegram

Check that your Telegram channel config has `inlineButtons` capability:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "capabilities": ["inlineButtons"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## CLI Tool

### Can I use the skill without OpenClaw?

Yes! The CLI tool works standalone:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..."
echo '[{"user":"What is Docker?","assistant":"Docker is..."}]' | followups-cli --mode text
```

### What input formats does the CLI accept?

JSON array of exchanges:
```json
[
  {"user": "What is Docker?", "assistant": "Docker is a containerization platform..."},
  {"user": "How is it different from VMs?", "assistant": "Key differences include..."}
]
```

Or pipe from a file: `cat conversation.json | followups-cli`

### What output formats are available?

- `json` — Raw JSON object
- `telegram` — Telegram inline buttons array
- `text` — Formatted text with categories
- `compact` — Simple numbered list
