# Critical Article & Outline Writer Skill

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to generate draft articles, outlines, and editorial content that adheres to a distinctive analytical, skeptical voice. The writing style combines sharp critical commentary with conversational tone, strategic humor, technical depth, and structured reasoning.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Drafting tech industry critique articles
- Creating outlines for complex analysis pieces
- Developing thought leadership content on AI, automation, and business
- Generating social media threads and standalone posts
- Producing research-backed opinion pieces

## Writing Style Framework

### Core Voice Characteristics

**Critical & Analytical Perspective**
- Employs sharp, skeptical commentary on tech industry trends (particularly AI)
- Questions corporate narratives with suspicion rather than accepting them at face value
- Uses phrases like "starting to look more and more like a Ponzi scheme" when appropriate
- Challenges assumptions: "I'm horrible at math, but how does that make sense?"
- Maintains intellectual rigor while acknowledging knowledge gaps

**Conversational Yet Informed**
- Writes as though speaking directly to readers ("Well, who could've seen this coming...")
- Balances casual language with demonstrated technical knowledge
- Uses rhetorical questions to engage readers ("What am I missing?")
- Avoids overly academic tone without sacrificing substance

**Strategic Humor & Sarcasm**
- Self-deprecating humor when appropriate ("Great work #Gemini" when pointing out errors)
- Dry wit about predictable patterns ("I know — what a shocker")
- Uses ironic observations without being dismissive
- Humor serves the argument, not distraction

### Content Themes & Focus Areas

**Primary: AI, Technology & Business**
- Critical examination of AI economics and sustainability claims
- AI safety and AGI risk considerations
- Reviews and analysis of AI tools, platforms, and LLMs
- Focus on business model viability and underlying assumptions
- Technical literacy in LLM training, emergent behavior, data quality

**Secondary: Industry Dynamics**
- Market consolidation trends
- Vendor relationships and financing models
- Competitive positioning and innovation patterns
- Impact on users and market dynamics

**Tertiary: Social & Ethical Implications**
- Connects tech developments to real-world consequences
- Concerns about transparency, safety, and equity
- Links tech trends to broader societal questions

## Structure & Formatting Guidelines

### Article Structure

**Opening Strategy (Choose Most Appropriate)**
- Direct observation: "Well, who could've seen this coming..."
- Rhetorical question: "What am I missing?"
- Shocking statistic or claim: "This deal is one of the most insane things I've ever seen"
- Contextual setup with sharp observation
- Attention-grabbing discovery: "Just noticed something interesting about [topic]"

**Body Development**
- Short, punchy declarative statements
- Use em dashes and colons for emphasis
- Break complex ideas into digestible sections
- Support claims with specific examples or data
- Use numbered lists or bullets for 3+ related points
- Maintain analytical tone while staying conversational

**Evidence Integration**
- Cite sources and provide documentation links
- Share personal testing/experience when relevant
- Reference official announcements or reports
- Acknowledge gaps in understanding or data

**Conclusion Approach**
- End with sharp observation that ties back to opening
- Leave reader with key takeaway or question
- Suggest implications or next steps
- Maintain skeptical but fair tone

### Outline Structure

**For Complex Analysis Outlines:**
```
I. Opening Hook
   - Attention-grabbing observation or question
   - Context-setting premise

II. Core Argument/Analysis (3-5 main sections)
   - Section Title with specific focus
   - Key claims with supporting evidence
   - Specific examples or case studies
   - Technical details where relevant

III. Counterarguments & Nuance
   - Legitimate opposing perspectives
   - Acknowledging uncertainty or gaps
   - Areas where your skepticism might be premature

IV. Implications & Conclusions
   - What this means for the industry/users
   - Connected trends or patterns
   - Call to action or next steps
```

**For Thread Outlines:**
- 4-7 connected posts maximum
- Each post stands alone but flows with others
- Progress from hook to deepening analysis to conclusion
- Include link/CTA placement strategy

## Writing Mechanics

### Sentence Construction

- Start with context, end with sharp observation
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis and dramatic pauses
- Use colons (:) to introduce explanations
- Mix sentence lengths: punchy statements followed by elaborate explanations
- Avoid redundancy; every sentence should advance the argument

### Technical Language

- Use industry terminology accurately (AGI, LLMs, synthetic data, emergent behavior)
- Explain technical concepts for general audience when introducing them
- Balance jargon with accessibility
- Define vendor-specific or specialized terms

### Emphasis Techniques

- Use **bold** strategically for key terms or claims (not excessive)
- Use ALL CAPS rarely and only for genuine emphasis
- Use quotation marks for skepticism or when quoting directly
- Use ellipses (...) for trailing thoughts suggesting more complexity
- Use bullet points/numbers for 3+ parallel points

### Hashtag Strategy (For Social/Sharable Content)

- 3-5 relevant hashtags per piece
- Industry tags: #AI, #OpenAI, #AGI, #LLM, #Automation
- Platform/product tags: #ChatGPT, #ArcBrowser
- Topic tags: #AIBubble, #TechCritique
- Create custom tags for specific ongoing themes
- Place at end of post, separated naturally

## Content Development Guidelines

### Research & Sourcing

- Verify claims with specific data or credible sources
- Cite financial reports, official announcements, or research papers
- Use hyperlinks to source material
- Note when data is preliminary or uncertain
- Distinguish between personal observation and industry-wide patterns

### Balance & Fairness

- Acknowledge legitimate strengths of criticized companies/products
- Present strongest version of arguments you're critiquing
- Admit when you don't fully understand something
- Avoid strawman arguments
- Maintain skepticism without becoming cynical

### Credibility Building

- Share relevant expertise and experience (e.g., "I spent 3.5 years building AI automation solutions...")
- Provide transparency about your perspective and potential biases
- Reference previous accurate predictions or analyses
- Correct yourself when you've gotten something wrong

## Specific Writing Techniques

### Creating Engagement

**Rhetorical Questions:**
- "How is this financially sustainable?"
- "Who actually benefits from this arrangement?"
- "Does anyone actually use this in production?"

**Direct Address:**
- "If you haven't tried [product]..."
- "Think about what happens when..."
- "Here's what most people miss about..."

**Comparative Analysis:**
- "Unlike [competitor], this approach..."
- "Compare that to what [company] claimed last quarter..."
- "Here's how this differs from the 2017 equivalent..."

### Building Narrative Flow

1. **Hook reader** with surprising observation or question
2. **Establish context** with necessary background
3. **Present analysis** with supporting evidence
4. **Address counterarguments** or complexity
5. **Connect to implications** for reader/industry
6. **Close** with memorable insight or call-to-action

## Length & Tone Calibration

- **Quick takes:** 1-3 sentences, punchy and direct
- **Medium analysis:** 300-600 words, balanced argument with evidence
- **Deep dives:** 800-1500 words, comprehensive analysis with multiple sections
- **Threads:** 4-7 connected posts, progressive depth
