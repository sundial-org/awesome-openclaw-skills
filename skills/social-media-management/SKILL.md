## **🎯 Multi-Dimensional Navigator**

**Content writing varies dramatically by industry, stage, and role. Find your path:**

### **STEP 1: What's Your Industry Vertical?**

Your industry determines:
- Tone and voice (aggressive vs conservative)
- Risk tolerance (what you can/cannot say)
- Approval workflows (direct publish vs legal review)
- Content topics and angles

```
→ Sales Tech - Aggressive, contrarian, data-driven
→ HR Tech - Professional, empathetic, research-backed
→ Fintech - Ultra-conservative, compliance-first
→ Operations Tech - Industry-specific, B2B2B2C nuanced
```

### **STEP 2: What's Your Company Stage?**

Your stage determines:
- Publishing frequency (founder bandwidth vs team)
- Content depth (tactical vs strategic)
- Approval requirements (founder autonomy vs committee)
- Resources available (DIY vs professional design)

```
→ Series A - Founder voice, scrappy, tactical
→ Series B - Team effort, professional, strategic
→ Series C+ - Corporate voice, brand-controlled, category-defining
```

### **STEP 3: Are You Founder or Employee?**

Your role determines:
- Editorial freedom (can you be contrarian?)
- Approval process (self-publish vs manager review)
- Personal vs company brand
- What topics are "safe" vs "risky"

```
→ Founder - Full autonomy, personal = company
→ VP/Director - Manager approval, aligned with brand
→ PMM/Content - Team collaboration, brand guidelines
→ Employee - Significant constraints, corporate voice
```

### **STEP 4: What's Your Primary Market?**

Your geography determines:
- Writing style (US direct vs India relationship-focused)
- Examples and case studies (local companies)
- Compliance considerations (GDPR mentions, etc.)

```
→ India - Relationship-driven, local examples, price-conscious
→ US - Direct, data-driven, premium positioning
```

# 📊 SECTION A: SALES TECH CONTENT WRITING

**When To Use This Section:**
- Your product: Sales engagement, conversation intelligence, sales enablement
- Your audience: Sales leaders, CROs, RevOps, SDR managers
- Your content angle: Tactical sales tips, data-driven insights, contrarian takes
- Voice: Aggressive, confident, ROI-focused, can challenge incumbents

---

## **A1: Sales Tech @ Series A (Founder Voice, Aggressive Allowed)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $1M-10M ARR, 10-100 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder or early marketing hire
- Content goal: Build thought leadership + leads
- Publishing: 3-5× per week (LinkedIn primary)
- Approval: None (founder autonomy)
- Time: 5-8 hours/week total
```

### **The Sales Tech Content Philosophy:**

**Why Sales Leaders Engage with Content:**

```
SALES LEADERS DON'T ENGAGE WITH:
❌ Generic motivational quotes
❌ Theory without data
❌ Long-winded essays (no time)
❌ Humble bragging ("We just closed...")

SALES LEADERS ENGAGE WITH:
✅ Data-driven insights ("Analyzed 10K calls, here's what top reps do")
✅ Tactical frameworks (copy-paste into your process)
✅ Contrarian takes ("Everyone is wrong about cold calling")
✅ Competitive intelligence ("What Gong doesn't tell you")
✅ ROI calculations ("This tactic = 23% more meetings")
```

### **Sales Tech Voice Guidelines:**

**AGGRESSIVENESS SPECTRUM (Sales Tech):**

```
TOO TIMID (Don't Do This):
"We think conversation intelligence might be helpful for some teams..."

APPROPRIATELY CONFIDENT (Do This):
"Gong analyzed 1M calls. We analyzed 2M. Here's what they missed."

TOO AGGRESSIVE (Even for Sales Tech):
"Gong is garbage. Their data is fake. We're 100× better."

SWEET SPOT:
- Confident, data-backed assertions
- Respectful but contrarian takes
- Challenge category leaders on methodology
- But: Never personal attacks, never unverified claims
```

### **Content Types for Sales Tech Founders:**

**CONTENT MIX (Sales Tech Series A):**

```
40% DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS
- "We analyzed X sales calls, here's what we found"
- "The data says [surprising insight]"
- Source: Your product data, public research (Gong, Pavilion)
- Length: 300-500 words
- Frequency: 2× per week

30% TACTICAL FRAMEWORKS
- "The 3-question discovery framework"
- "How to handle pricing objections [step-by-step]"
- Source: Your experience, customer wins
- Length: 400-600 words
- Frequency: 1-2× per week

20% CONTRARIAN TAKES
- "Why everyone is wrong about [X]"
- "Gong says [X], but the data shows [Y]"
- Source: Your unique perspective, counter-research
- Length: 200-400 words
- Frequency: 1× per week

10% PERSONAL/BEHIND-THE-SCENES
- "How we lost a $50K deal (and what I learned)"
- "The sales hire that changed our trajectory"
- Source: Your journey
- Length: 300-500 words
- Frequency: 1× every 2 weeks
```

### **Series A Sales Tech: Daily Content Workflow**

**MONDAY: Data-Driven Insight (1.5 hours)**

```
09:00-09:30 | Find Data

SALES TECH DATA SOURCES:
□ Your product: Export anonymized metrics
  Example: "Average discovery call = 32 minutes in our data"
  
□ Public research:
  - Gong Labs reports (free)
  - Pavilion benchmarks (if member)
  - Public earnings calls (check Salesforce, ZoomInfo)
  
□ Customer interviews:
  - "What was your close rate before/after using us?"
  - Turn into: "Customer X increased close rate 23%"

09:30-10:30 | Write Post

STRUCTURE:

**HOOK (First 2 lines):**
"We analyzed 50,000 sales calls from SMB B2B SaaS companies.
The average discovery call is 32 minutes. But top performers? 19 minutes."

**BUILD (3-5 paragraphs):**
Why this matters:
- Shorter calls = more qualified prospects
- Top reps ask fewer questions (but better ones)
- They don't "interrogate," they diagnose

What we found:
1. Average rep asks 18 questions in discovery
2. Top rep asks 9 questions (but they're open-ended)
3. Top rep listens 67% of the time (vs 42% for average)

**PAYOFF (1-2 paragraphs):**
The 3 questions top reps always ask:
1. "Walk me through your current process for [X]"
2. "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 90 days?"
3. "Who else is impacted by this problem?"

**CTA:**
"What's your go-to discovery question?"

10:30-11:00 | Edit & Publish

SALES TECH EDITING CHECKLIST:
□ Cut 20-30% of words (brevity = respect for time)
□ Verify: Every claim has data/source
□ Add: Numbers, percentages, specifics
□ Remove: Fluff, qualifiers ("I think," "maybe")
□ Check: Does this make sales leaders smarter?

PUBLISH:
- Time: 9 AM EST / 6 AM PST (catch US East + West)
- If India: 9 AM IST (catch Indian B2B audience)
- Platform: LinkedIn primary, Twitter thread secondary
```

**TUESDAY: Tactical Framework (1.5 hours)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK:**
"The pricing objection framework every SDR should memorize:
(Learned this from watching 1,000+ pricing conversations)"

**FRAMEWORK:**
When they say: "That's too expensive"

DON'T say:
❌ "We're actually quite affordable"
❌ "Let me talk to my manager about a discount"
❌ "What's your budget?"

DO say (3-step framework):

Step 1: REFRAME
"Expensive compared to what? [competitor]?"
→ Forces them to make comparison explicit

Step 2: QUANTIFY THEIR PROBLEM
"Walk me through what this problem costs you today.
 How many hours per week? What's your team's loaded cost?"
→ Now you have their ROI baseline

Step 3: CONTRAST VALUE
"So you're spending $50K/year in time right now.
 Our solution is $15K/year and eliminates 90% of that.
 That's a $35K gain. Does that math work?"
→ Reframe from cost to investment

**EXAMPLE:**
[Insert short dialogue showing this in action]

**CTA:**
"Try this next time you hear 'too expensive.'
 Let me know how it goes."

LENGTH: 400-600 words
TIME: 1.5 hours (research + write + edit)
```

**WEDNESDAY: Contrarian Take (1 hour)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK (Provocative):**
"Unpopular opinion: Gong is making your sales team WORSE.
(And I have data to prove it)"

**SETUP:**
Everyone thinks conversation intelligence = better sales.
More data = better coaching = more wins.

But here's what we're seeing:

**THE CONTRARIAN INSIGHT:**
When sales teams get Gong:
- Month 1-3: 15% improvement (reps more aware)
- Month 4-6: Flatline (back to baseline)
- Month 7+: Often 5-10% decline

Why?
1. Analysis paralysis (too much data, not enough action)
2. Reps game the metrics (talk more to hit "talk time" goals)
3. Managers overwhelmed (100 dashboards, 0 time to coach)

**THE ALTERNATIVE VIEW:**
Conversation intelligence isn't the problem.
How you USE it is.

Best teams:
- Track 3 metrics max (not 30)
- Focus on ONE skill per quarter
- Coach live (not post-call reviews)

**NUANCE (Important for Aggressive Takes):**
"Am I saying Gong is bad? No.
Am I saying most teams use it wrong? Yes."

**CTA:**
"Using conversation intelligence? What's working for you?"

RISK LEVEL: Medium-High
APPROVAL: Founder only (don't do this as employee)
WHEN: Only if you have data + alternative
```

**THURSDAY: Quick Tip (30 minutes)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK:**
"The 2-minute LinkedIn outreach hack that 3× my reply rate:"

**THE HACK:**
Before sending connection request:
1. Comment on their post (genuine, add value)
2. Wait 24 hours
3. THEN send personalized connection request

Why it works:
- They remember you (positive association)
- Not cold anymore (warm intro via comment)
- Shows you did research (not spray-and-pray)

**EXAMPLE:**
[Screenshot or dialogue]

**CTA:**
"Try it. Let me know your reply rate."

LENGTH: 150-250 words
TIME: 30 minutes
FREQUENCY: 1× per week (easy win days)
```

**FRIDAY: Customer Win / Case Study (1 hour)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK:**
"How a 10-person startup beat Salesforce for a $100K deal:
(A masterclass in positioning)"

**SETUP:**
Our customer: Small sales tech startup
Competitor: Salesforce (800 lb gorilla)
Deal size: $100K annual

How they won:

**THE STORY:**
Step 1: They DIDN'T compete on features
→ Salesforce has 10× more features
→ That's a losing battle

Step 2: They reframed the decision
→ "You have 15 sales reps. Salesforce is built for 500+ rep teams.
   You'll pay for complexity you don't need."

Step 3: They offered implementation in 1 week
→ Salesforce: 3-month implementation
→ Them: Live in 1 week

Step 4: They made it founder-to-founder
→ CEO jumped on call (rare for Salesforce)
→ Committed to being "partner, not vendor"

**THE WIN:**
Customer chose them despite:
- Salesforce brand
- Salesforce features
- Salesforce pricing power

Why?
- Speed to value
- Right-sized solution
- Personal relationship

**LESSON:**
"Don't compete on the incumbent's terms.
 Reframe the decision criteria."

**CTA:**
"Ever competed against a giant? How'd you position?"

LENGTH: 500-700 words
TIME: 1 hour
FREQUENCY: 1× per week
```

### **LinkedIn Algorithm Optimization (Sales Tech):**

```
POST TIMING:
✅ Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST (highest engagement)
✅ Avoid Monday AM (too busy), Friday PM (weekend mode)

For India market:
✅ Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM-2 PM IST

POST LENGTH:
✅ 300-600 words (sweet spot for LinkedIn)
❌ <100 words (not enough depth)
❌ >800 words (tl;dr, save for newsletter)

ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:
□ First comment: Add value (not "What do you think?")
□ Reply to all comments within first hour (algorithm boost)
□ Ask specific question in CTA (not generic "Thoughts?")
□ Tag max 2 people (more = spam signal)
□ Use 3-5 hashtags max (Sales, SalesLeadership, B2BSales, etc.)

CAROUSEL STRATEGY (Sales Tech Specific):
When: Complex frameworks, multi-step processes, data visualization
Format: 7-10 slides
Structure:
- Slide 1: Hook (bold claim + data point)
- Slides 2-8: Framework/data (one point per slide)
- Slide 9: Summary (recap key points)
- Slide 10: CTA (apply this, share results)

Tools:
- Free: Canva (templates available)
- Paid: Taplio ($29/mo), Shield ($12/mo)
```

# 📊 SECTION B: HR TECH CONTENT WRITING

**When To Use This Section:**
- Your product: HRIS, employee engagement, performance, recruiting
- Your audience: HR leaders, CHROs, People Ops, Talent teams
- Your content angle: Employee experience, people analytics, culture
- Voice: Professional, empathetic, research-backed (NEVER aggressive)

---

## **B1: HR Tech @ Series A (Founder, Professional Voice Required)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $2M-8M ARR, 20-80 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder (often ex-CHRO background)
- Content goal: Build trust, establish expertise
- Publishing: 2-3× per week (quality > quantity)
- Voice: Professional, empathetic, never aggressive
```

### **Why HR Tech Content is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT:**

```
SALES TECH CONTENT:
✅ Aggressive, contrarian takes
✅ "Gong is wrong about X"
✅ Challenge incumbents publicly
✅ Data-driven, ROI-focused
Risk: Low (worst case = lose followers)

HR TECH CONTENT:
❌ NEVER aggressive or confrontational
❌ NEVER "Competitor X is wrong"
❌ NEVER attack category leaders
✅ Professional, empathetic, supportive
✅ Research-backed, people-focused
Risk: HIGH (HR community is small, reputation matters)

WHY THE DIFFERENCE:
- HR community is tight-knit (everyone knows everyone)
- HR leaders value relationships over aggressive positioning
- HR topics are sensitive (people, culture, layoffs)
- Attacking competitors = unprofessional (damages your brand)
- CHRO job changes = everyone moves to different companies
  → Today's competitor could be tomorrow's customer/partner
```

### **HR Tech Voice Guidelines:**

**TONE SPECTRUM (HR Tech):**

```
TOO AGGRESSIVE (Never Do This):
"Traditional performance reviews are BROKEN. Anyone still using them is hurting their team."
→ Judgmental, attacks current practices

TOO SOFT (Also Wrong):
"We think maybe employee engagement could possibly be important..."
→ Lacks confidence, not thought leadership

APPROPRIATE (Do This):
"Research shows traditional annual reviews have limitations. Here's what forward-thinking CHROs are trying instead."
→ Research-backed, helpful, not judgmental

IDEAL HR TECH VOICE:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Research-backed (cite studies, surveys)
- Empathetic (understand HR challenges)
- Helpful (provide frameworks, not just criticism)
- Inclusive (not everyone can afford premium tools)
- Professional (appropriate for CHRO audience)
```

### **Content Types for HR Tech Founders:**

**CONTENT MIX (HR Tech Series A):**

### **HR Tech Daily Content Workflow (3× per Week)**

**MONDAY: Research-Backed Insight (2 hours)**

```
08:00-09:00 | Find Research

HR TECH RESEARCH SOURCES:
□ SHRM (Society for HR Management) - industry gold standard
□ Josh Bersin research - HR thought leader
□ Culture Amp blog - engagement benchmarks
□ Lattice blog - performance management insights
□ Gartner HR research (if accessible)
□ Harvard Business Review - people management
□ Academic journals - organizational psychology

09:00-10:00 | Write Post

STRUCTURE:

**HOOK (Research Finding):**
"Culture Amp's 2026 benchmark report analyzed 500,000 employee surveys.
The #1 driver of retention isn't compensation. It's manager effectiveness.
By a margin of 3×."

**CONTEXT:**
This challenges conventional wisdom.
Most CHROs focus budget on:
- Competitive comp packages
- Benefits improvements
- Perks (ping pong, free lunch)

Meanwhile, the data shows:
- Manager quality = 3× more predictive of retention
- Direct manager relationship = #1 factor
- Yet: 60% of companies have no manager training budget

**FRAMEWORK:**
What top-performing companies do differently:
1. Manager selection (promote based on leadership, not tenure)
2. Manager training (quarterly coaching skills development)
3. Manager accountability (retention = performance metric)

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**
For small teams (50-200 employees):
- Start: Monthly manager training (2-hour sessions)
- Focus: 1 skill per quarter (giving feedback, career development, etc.)
- Measure: Manager effectiveness scores in engagement surveys

For mid-market (200-1000):
- Implement: Manager development program
- Budget: $500-1K per manager annually
- ROI: If retention improves 5%, savings = $X (calculate)

**CTA (Professional):**
"How does your company invest in manager development?
I'd love to learn from your approach."

NOT: "What do you think?" (too generic)
NOT: "Tag a bad manager" (unprofessional)
```

**WEDNESDAY: Practical Framework (2 hours)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK:**
"The 1-on-1 framework I've used with 50+ managers.
(Backed by research from MIT Sloan and Josh Bersin)"

**PROBLEM:**
Most 1-on-1s are status updates.
Manager asks: "What are you working on?"
Employee shares: "Project X, Project Y"
No growth. No connection. No development.

**FRAMEWORK: THE 3-TOPIC STRUCTURE**

Topic 1: IMMEDIATE (10 minutes)
- What's blocking you this week?
- Where do you need help?
- Any urgent concerns?

Topic 2: DEVELOPMENT (15 minutes)
- What skill do you want to build this quarter?
- What stretch opportunity interests you?
- How can I support your growth?

Topic 3: CONNECTION (5 minutes)
- How are you feeling about work?
- What's energizing you lately?
- Anything personal I should know about?

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
Research shows effective 1-on-1s have 3 elements:
1. Task support (immediate blockers)
2. Career development (future growth)
3. Relationship building (personal connection)

Most managers only do #1.
Top managers balance all 3.

**TEMPLATE:**
"Here's a simple template you can copy:
[Link to doc or image]"

**CTA:**
"What's your 1-on-1 structure?
Always looking to improve mine."

TONE: Helpful, not preachy
```

**FRIDAY: Empathetic Observation (1.5 hours)**

```
STRUCTURE:

**HOOK (Vulnerable Opening):**
"The CHRO challenge no one talks about:
You're responsible for culture. But you don't control it."

**SETUP:**
Every CHRO has felt this:
- CEO wants "better culture"
- Board asks about "employee engagement scores"
- But: You can't mandate culture

You can:
- Design programs
- Measure engagement
- Create policies

You can't:
- Control manager quality
- Force authentic relationships
- Manufacture belonging

**THE TENSION:**
This creates an impossible dynamic:
→ Accountable for outcomes
→ Limited control over inputs
→ Success depends on 100+ managers you don't directly manage

**WHAT HELPS:**
After talking to 30+ CHROs about this:

1. REFRAME YOUR ROLE
Not: "Owner of culture"
But: "Enabler of culture"

You don't create culture.
Managers create culture.
You enable them to do it well.

2. FOCUS ON SYSTEMS
- Manager selection (who gets promoted)
- Manager training (how we develop leaders)
- Manager accountability (metrics that matter)

3. MEASURE LEADING INDICATORS
Not just: Annual engagement scores
But: Monthly manager effectiveness scores

**CTA:**
"Fellow CHROs: How do you navigate this tension?
What's helped you?"

TONE: Vulnerable but professional
GOAL: Build community, not just thought leadership
```

### **HR Tech: What NEVER to Post**

```
❌ NEVER POST:

"Workday is terrible. Here's why:"
→ Attacks competitor (unprofessional)

"If your company still does annual reviews, you're behind"
→ Judgmental to audience (many still do this)

"The engagement survey results that shocked us [gossip]"
→ Violates employee privacy

"We just poached a great CHRO from [Company]"
→ Inappropriate, burns bridges

"Hot take: HR is mostly useless"
→ Self-destructive, alienates audience

"Check out this hilarious HR meme [generic meme]"
→ Low-value, undermines expertise

RULE FOR HR TECH:
If you wouldn't say it at SHRM Annual Conference, don't post it on LinkedIn.
```

## **B2: HR Tech @ Series B (Team Content, Brand Voice)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:

- Publishing: 3-5× per week
- Approval: Manager/Founder for sensitive topics
- Budget: $5K-15K/month
```

### **Series B HR Tech: Elevated Professional Content**

```
TEAM STRUCTURE:

CONTENT DIRECTOR (You):
- Strategy (topics, angles, positioning)
- Stakeholder management (Founder/CHRO, Sales, Product)
- Approval (final sign-off)
- Metrics (engagement, brand awareness, pipeline)

HR CONTENT WRITER (1 FTE):
- Ideally: Background in HR or People Ops
- Research (SHRM, Josh Bersin, academic studies)
- Writing (blog posts, LinkedIn, thought leadership)
- Editing (professional quality)

DESIGNER (Part-time):
- People-focused visuals (diverse, inclusive imagery)
- Data visualization (engagement benchmarks, survey results)
- Brand consistency (HR Tech = warm, professional aesthetic)

FOUNDER/CHRO (Guest Voice):
- 1× per week under their name
- Strategic POV, industry trends
- Vulnerable shares (culture challenges)

APPROVAL WORKFLOW:

STANDARD POST (Research summary, framework):
Writer → Content Director → Publish
Timeline: Same day to 1 day

Timeline: 2-3 days

SENSITIVE POST (Layoffs, DE&I, compensation):
Writer → Content Director → VP Marketing → Founder/CHRO → Legal (if needed)
Timeline: 3-7 days

WHY STRICTER APPROVAL FOR HR TECH:
- People topics = sensitive (layoffs, DE&I, mental health)
- Legal risk (employment law, EEOC, GDPR)
- Reputation risk (HR community is small)

```

### **Series B HR Tech: Sensitive Topic Guidelines**

```
LAYOFFS / WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS:

IF YOUR COMPANY IS LAYING OFF:
❌ Don't post about it personally until official announcement
❌ Don't hint or foreshadow ("Hard times ahead...")
✅ Wait for official company communication
✅ Then: Can share empathetic reflection (after announcement)

IF WRITING ABOUT LAYOFFS GENERALLY:
✅ Empathetic tone (people are losing jobs)
✅ Practical guidance (for HR leaders navigating this)
✅ Mental health resources
❌ "Layoffs are good actually" (insensitive)
❌ Naming companies doing layoffs (unless public news)

EXAMPLE POST (After Your Company Layoff):
"We had to make difficult decisions this week.
As someone who had to deliver the news to incredible people,
here's what I learned about navigating reductions with empathy:

1. Clarity (people deserve straightforward communication)
2. Dignity (everyone gets proper support)
3. Transparency (explain the why, not just the what)

This is hard. If you're going through this, I see you."

TONE: Humble, empathetic, human

---

DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION (DE&I):

APPROPRIATE CONTENT:
✅ Share research on DE&I impact
✅ Best practices (blind resume reviews, structured interviews)
✅ Personal commitment ("We're working on...")
✅ Progress + transparency ("Here's where we are...")

INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT:
❌ Virtue signaling ("We're the most diverse!")
❌ Tokenism (featuring one diverse employee repeatedly)
❌ Oversimplifying complex topics
❌ Speaking over marginalized communities

GUIDANCE:
- If you're not from the community, amplify voices that are
- Focus on systems/policies (not individual stories without permission)
- Be honest about challenges (not just wins)
- Legal review recommended (DE&I = potential discrimination claims)

---

MENTAL HEALTH:

APPROPRIATE CONTENT:
✅ Normalize mental health discussions
✅ Share company resources (EAP, mental health days)
✅ Manager training on recognizing signs
✅ Empathetic leadership (sharing your own experience)

INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT:
❌ Armchair diagnosing ("I think X has anxiety")
❌ Oversharing personal struggles (maintain professionalism)
❌ Suggesting company programs replace professional help

DISCLAIMERS:
Always include: "If you're struggling, please seek professional help.
Resources: [crisis hotline, EAP, etc.]"

# 📊 SECTION C: FINTECH CONTENT WRITING

**When To Use This Section:**
- Your product: Payments, expense management, corporate cards, payroll
- Your audience: CFOs, Finance leaders, Controllers
- Your content angle: Regulations, compliance, financial efficiency
- Voice: ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE (legal review mandatory)

## **C1: Fintech @ Series A (Every Post Needs Legal Review)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $2M-8M ARR, 20-100 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder
- Content goal: Build trust (not leads - trust comes first)
- Publishing: 1-2× per week (slower due to legal review)
- CRITICAL: Legal review mandatory for every single post
- Voice: Conservative, compliant, trustworthy
```

### **Why Fintech Content is HIGHEST RISK:**

```
SALES TECH:
✅ Aggressive positioning
✅ "Gong is wrong about X"
Risk: Low (lose followers)

HR TECH:
⚠️ Professional, no attacks
Risk: Medium (reputation)

FINTECH:
🔴 ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE MANDATORY
🔴 LEGAL REVIEW FOR EVERY POST
🔴 NEVER make unverified claims
🔴 NEVER attack competitors
🔴 NEVER share user data
Risk: EXTREME (regulatory fines, license revocation, criminal liability)

WHY:
- Financial regulations: RBI (India), SEC (US), FCA (UK)
- Financial advertising rules: Can't make unverified ROI claims
- Data privacy: Can't share user financial data (RBI compliance)
- Reputational risk: Finance = trust-driven (one mistake = brand death)
- Legal liability: Directors personally liable for violations
```

### **Fintech Content Guidelines (Non-Negotiable):**

```
✅ ALWAYS ALLOWED:

"RBI released new payment aggregator guidelines. Here's what fintech companies need to know:"
→ Regulatory updates (factual, helpful)

"3 compliance checklist items for Indian fintechs [2026 edition]"
→ Educational, compliance-focused

"How we achieved SOC 2 compliance in 12 months [timeline]"
→ Your journey (factual, no claims about others)

"CFO's guide to expense management compliance"
→ Educational, helpful

❌ NEVER ALLOWED:

"Traditional banking is broken. Here's why fintech is better."
→ Attacks incumbents (regulatory risk)

"Save 50% on payment fees with our solution"
→ Unverified ROI claim (unless proven and methodology disclosed)

"We're the fastest-growing fintech in India"
→ Superlative claim (unless third-party verified)

"Customer X saved ₹10L using our product"
→ Customer data (compliance violation without written permission)

"Why [Competitor] is overpriced"
→ Competitor attack (could trigger legal action)

CRITICAL RULE:
If you're not 100% certain it's compliant, get legal review.
In fintech, "better to ask forgiveness" DOES NOT APPLY.
```

### **Fintech Content Mix (Conservative):**

```
60% REGULATORY/COMPLIANCE UPDATES
- "New RBI guidelines for payment companies"
- "KYC requirements: What changed in 2026"
- "Data localization compliance checklist"
Source: Official sources only (RBI, NPCI, Ministry of Finance)
Tone: Factual, educational, helpful
Frequency: 1× per week (as regulations change)

25% EDUCATIONAL BEST PRACTICES
- "CFO's guide to corporate expense management"
- "How to evaluate payment aggregators [checklist]"
- "SOC 2 compliance: Step-by-step guide"
Source: Industry standards, your experience
Tone: Helpful, not sales-y
Frequency: 1× every 2 weeks

10% COMPANY UPDATES (Factual Only)
- "We achieved SOC 2 Type II certification"
- "Announcing: RBI Payment Aggregator license"
- "New integration: Zoho Books"
Source: Your company (factual announcements)
Tone: Professional, humble
Frequency: As milestones happen

5% THOUGHT LEADERSHIP (Extremely Careful)
- "The future of UPI payments in India [analysis]"
- "Cross-border payments: 2027 predictions"
Source: Industry trends (clearly labeled as opinion)
Tone: Measured, balanced, acknowledges uncertainty
Frequency: Monthly or less
```

### **Fintech Approval Workflow (Mandatory):**

```
EVERY POST FOLLOWS THIS PROCESS:

STEP 1: DRAFT (You or Writer)
- Write post
- Cite all sources
- Include disclaimers
Time: 1-2 hours

STEP 2: SELF-CHECK
□ Is this factual? (verifiable)
□ Do I cite sources? (RBI, official sources)
□ Am I making claims? (if yes, can I prove them?)
□ Am I mentioning competitors? (if yes, is it necessary?)
□ Am I sharing user data? (if yes, do I have written permission?)
□ Is there any regulatory risk? (when in doubt, YES)

STEP 3: LEGAL REVIEW (1-3 days)
- Send to legal counsel
- They review for:
  * Regulatory compliance
  * Financial advertising rules
  * Data privacy
  * Competitor mention risk
- They may:
  * Approve as-is
  * Request edits
  * Reject entirely

STEP 4: REVISE (If Needed)
- Incorporate legal feedback
- Re-submit for final approval

STEP 5: PUBLISH
- Only after legal sign-off
- Include all required disclaimers

TIMELINE:
- Simple post: 1-2 days (draft → legal → publish)
- Complex post: 3-5 days
- Controversial topic: May be rejected

COST:
- Legal counsel retainer: $5K-10K/month
- Per-post review: $200-500 (if not on retainer)
- Worth it: Avoiding ₹1 Cr fine or license revocation
```

### **Fintech Examples (Compliant vs Non-Compliant):**

```
TOPIC: Payment Processing Speeds

❌ NON-COMPLIANT:
"We process payments 10× faster than Razorpay.
Switch to us and save hours of processing time."

ISSUES:
- Unverified claim ("10× faster" - can you prove it?)
- Competitor attack (Razorpay could sue)
- Implied guarantee ("save hours" - what if customer doesn't?)

✅ COMPLIANT:
"Payment processing speeds vary by provider and use case.
In our testing with 100 transactions, average processing time was X seconds.
(Methodology: [link to documentation])"

WHY IT'S COMPLIANT:
- Factual (your own testing)
- Methodology disclosed
- No competitor attacks
- No guarantees

---

TOPIC: Cost Savings

❌ NON-COMPLIANT:
"Save 50% on payment fees!"

ISSUES:
- Unverified ROI claim
- No methodology
- Implies guarantee

✅ COMPLIANT:
"Payment fee structures vary by volume and use case.
Our pricing: X% per transaction + ₹Y fixed fee.
[Link to pricing page]
Compare options based on your transaction volume."

WHY IT'S COMPLIANT:
- Factual (your own pricing)
- No claims about competitors
- No ROI guarantee
- Helpful (empowers comparison)
```

- Your audience: Sales/Ops leaders at CPG/FMCG companies
- Your content angle: Distribution, retail, supply chain
- Voice: Industry-specific, B2B2B2C complexity

## **D1: Operations Tech @ Series A (Niche Industry Focus)**

### **Your Reality Check:**

```
COMPANY PROFILE:
- Size: $1M-5M ARR, 15-60 employees
- Stage: Series A
- You: Founder (ex-CPG or tech)
- Content focus: India retail execution insights
- Publishing: 2-3× per week
- Audience: Small but highly engaged (CPG sales leaders)
```

### **Why Operations Tech Content is NICHE:**

```
SALES/HR/FINTECH:
- Broad audience (all B2B SaaS)
- Generic topics (sales, HR, finance)
- Large following potential (10K+ followers)

OPERATIONS TECH:
- Niche audience (CPG/FMCG/logistics)
- Specific topics (retail execution, distribution, field force)
- Smaller following (1K-3K) but HIGH engagement
- B2B2B2C complexity (You → CPG → Distributor → Retailer → Consumer)

ADVANTAGE OF NICHE:
✅ Less competition (few people write about retail execution)
✅ Higher engagement rate (exactly what audience needs)
✅ Easier to become THE expert
✅ Stronger community (CPG sales leaders all know each other)
✅ Higher intent leads (if they follow you, they're serious)
```

# 🔄 CROSS-CUTTING: UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORKS

## **Role-Based Content Workflows**

### **FOUNDER CONTENT (Full Autonomy)**

```
ADVANTAGES:
✅ No approval needed (publish freely)
✅ Personal voice = authentic
✅ Can be contrarian (if industry allows)
✅ Can share company metrics
✅ Can pivot messaging quickly

WORKFLOW:
Monday: Idea generation (30 min)
Tuesday: Write post #1 (1 hour)
Wednesday: Publish + engage (30 min)
Thursday: Write post #2 (1 hour)
Friday: Publish + weekly recap (30 min)

Total time: 3.5 hours/week

BEST PRACTICES:
□ Batch content (write 2-3 posts in one sitting)
□ Use voice memos (capture ideas on the go)
□ Repurpose (newsletter → LinkedIn → Twitter thread)
□ Engage (comment on others' posts daily)
□ Track (what topics get most engagement?)
```

### **EMPLOYEE CONTENT (Approval Required)**

```
SCENARIO: VP Marketing Writing Personal Content

CHALLENGES:
⚠️ Company wants brand consistency
⚠️ Can't share company confidential info
⚠️ Must add "Views are my own" disclaimer
⚠️ Manager needs to approve (at minimum)

APPROVAL WORKFLOW:

STEP 1: Get Manager Alignment (One-Time)
□ Pitch: "I want to build thought leadership in [category]"
□ Clarify: Personal brand, not company official content
□ Agree on boundaries:
  - What I CAN share about company
  - What I CANNOT share
  - Approval process

STEP 2: Write with Constraints
CAN SHARE:
✅ Industry insights (not company-specific)
✅ Your professional opinions
✅ Public company information
✅ General frameworks

CANNOT SHARE:
❌ Revenue/ARR/growth numbers (unless public)
❌ Roadmap/unannounced features
❌ Customer names (without permission)
❌ Internal metrics/team size
❌ Fundraising plans

STEP 3: Add Disclaimer
EVERY post includes:
"Views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of [Company Name]."

STEP 4: Periodic Review
□ Monthly: Show manager your content
□ Quarterly: Confirm still aligned with company
□ Annually: Review and renew agreement

WORKFLOW (Slower Than Founder):
Monday: Draft post #1
Tuesday: Get manager feedback
Wednesday: Revise + publish
Thursday-Friday: Draft post #2 (publish Monday)

Time: 4-5 hours/week (approval adds overhead)
```

### **ENTERPRISE EMPLOYEE (Corporate Comms Control)**

```
SCENARIO: CMO at Public SaaS Company

REALITY:
🔴 EVERYTHING requires PR approval
🔴 Can't publish without 1-2 week review
🔴 Ghost-written by PR team
🔴 No personal opinions
🔴 No controversial takes

CONSTRAINTS:
□ All posts pre-approved by:
  - Corporate Communications
  - Legal (if financial topics)
  - Executive team
  - Investor Relations (if public company)
  
□ Topics must be:
  - Brand-safe
  - On-message
  - Non-controversial
  - Aligned with company narrative

□ Timeline:
  - Draft → Corporate Comms (3-5 days)
  - Revisions (2-3 days)
  - Legal review (1-2 days if needed)
  - Final approval (1 day)
  - Total: 1-2 weeks per post

OPTIONS:
1. Accept constraints (corporate voice)
2. Limit posting (1× per month, big announcements only)
3. Internal content only (employees, not public)
4. Wait until you leave company (build personal brand then)

RECOMMENDATION:
If at public company or highly-regulated industry:
→ Focus on thought leadership via:
  - Speaking at conferences (pre-approved topics)
  - Bylines in trade publications (legal review)
  - Podcasts as guest (talking points approved)
→ Save personal LinkedIn brand for next role
```

## **Geography-Specific Content Strategies**

### **India Content Strategy:**

```
PUBLISHING TIMES:
✅ Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM-2 PM IST
✅ Avoid Monday early (week starting)
✅ Avoid Friday late (weekend mode)

CONTENT STYLE:
- Relationship-focused (build connections)
- Local examples (FieldAssist, not Gong)
- Price-conscious (acknowledge budget constraints)
- WhatsApp mentions ("Share this in your team WhatsApp group")

EXAMPLES:
✅ "How Darwinbox scaled from 100 to 1,000 customers"
✅ "Retail execution in India: General trade vs modern trade"
✅ "RBI's new guidelines for payment companies"
❌ "How we're disrupting the US market" (wrong geography)

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:
□ SaaSBoomi (India B2B SaaS community)
□ IAMAI (fintech, if applicable)
□ India-specific LinkedIn groups
□ Respond to comments in IST hours
```

### **US Content Strategy:**

```
PUBLISHING TIMES:
✅ Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST
✅ Some success: 12-2 PM EST (lunch scrolling)
✅ Avoid early mornings (West Coast asleep)

CONTENT STYLE:
- Direct, data-driven
- US examples (Gong, Lattice, Stripe)
- Premium positioning (value > price)
- Email CTAs ("Download the report")

EXAMPLES:
✅ "How Gong uses conversation intelligence [analysis]"
✅ "Sales tech landscape: The rise of AI coaching"
✅ "SOC 2 compliance timeline for SaaS companies"
❌ "How we're winning in India" (wrong geography for US audience)

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:
□ SaaStr (B2B SaaS)
□ Pavilion (GTM leaders)
□ Revenue Collective (CROs)
□ Respond during US business hours
```

## **Common Content Mistakes & How to Fix**

### **Mistake 1: "Writing Same Way for All Industries"**

```
WRONG:
Same aggressive contrarian post for Sales Tech, HR Tech, and Fintech

WHY IT FAILS:
- Sales Tech: Aggressive = good
- HR Tech: Aggressive = unprofessional
- Fintech: Aggressive = regulatory risk

FIX:
→ Sales Tech → Section A (aggressive allowed)
→ HR Tech → Section B (professional required)
→ Fintech → Section C (ultra-conservative mandatory)
```

### **Mistake 2: "No Approval Process (When You Need One)"**

```
SCENARIO: Employee Publishes Without Manager Knowing

RISKS:
- Share confidential info accidentally
- Company asks you to delete post (embarrassing)
- Misaligned with company messaging
- Career risk (manager upset)

FIX:
→ Role-Based Workflows section
→ Get manager alignment BEFORE posting
→ Monthly check-ins on content
```

### **Mistake 3: "Publishing at Wrong Times"**

```
PROBLEM:
Publishing Friday 5 PM EST for US sales leaders

RESULT:
- Low engagement (everyone checked out)
- Algorithm doesn't boost
- Wasted content

FIX:
- India: Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM-2 PM IST
- US: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST
- Test and track what works for YOUR audience
```

## **Worked Examples: Multi-Dimensional Scenarios**

### **Example 1: Sales Tech Founder, Series A, Aggressive Post**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: AI sales coaching, $3M ARR, 30 employees
- You: Co-founder & CEO
- Goal: Challenge Gong's methodology (contrarian take)
- Platform: LinkedIn
- Approval: None (founder autonomy)

CONTENT APPROACH:

TOPIC: "Gong's data on discovery calls is misleading. Here's why:"

STEP 1: GATHER DATA (Your Product)
- Export: 50,000 sales calls from your product
- Analyze: Average discovery call length
- Finding: Your data shows 25 minutes (vs Gong's 38 minutes)
- Hypothesis: Different ICP (SMB vs enterprise)

STEP 2: WRITE HOOK (Aggressive but Credible)
"Gong says the average discovery call is 38 minutes.
We analyzed 50,000 calls and found 25 minutes.

Here's what Gong missed:"

STEP 3: BUILD CASE (Data-Driven)
The difference:
- Gong's data: Skews enterprise (longer, more complex sales)
- Our data: Focuses SMB B2B SaaS (faster cycles)
- SMB discovery: 15-25 minutes (more efficient)
- Enterprise discovery: 35-45 minutes (more stakeholders)

STEP 4: NUANCE (Important)
"Am I saying Gong is wrong? No.
Am I saying their data doesn't apply to SMB? Yes.

If you're selling to SMB, optimize for 20-minute discovery.
If you're enterprise, 35-40 minutes is right."

STEP 5: PUBLISH + AMPLIFY
- LinkedIn: Tuesday 9 AM EST
- First comment: Link to methodology
- Tag: @mention Gong (they might engage)
- Monitor: Reply to all comments within 1 hour

RESULT:
- Engagement: 2-3× normal (controversial = engagement)
- Comments: Mix of agreement + Gong defenders (debate = algorithm boost)
- Leads: 15-20 inbound "I agree with your SMB POV"
- Gong might respond (if they do, be respectful)

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Risk level: Medium (challenging industry leader)
- Mitigation: Data-backed, nuanced, respectful
- Worst case: Gong ignores or politely disagrees
- Best case: Healthy debate, massive reach
```

### **Example 2: HR Tech VP, Series B, Sensitive Topic (Layoffs)**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: Employee engagement platform, $20M ARR
- You: VP Marketing
- Context: Your company just laid off 15% of staff
- Goal: Address layoffs professionally
- Constraint: Can't post until official announcement

TIMELINE:

DAY 1 (Layoff Day):
❌ Don't post anything on LinkedIn yet
✅ Focus on: Supporting impacted employees internally
✅ Wait for: Official company communication

DAY 2-3 (After Official Announcement):
✅ Now you can post (company has communicated)

CONTENT APPROACH:

STEP 1: CHECK WITH LEADERSHIP
Before writing:
□ Does CEO/CHRO want me to post?
□ What's the approved messaging?
□ Any topics to avoid?
□ Legal review needed?

STEP 2: WRITE POST (Empathetic, Honest)

HOOK:
"We made difficult decisions this week.
As someone who had to deliver hard news to people I deeply respect,
I want to share what I learned about navigating reductions with empathy."

BODY:
What mattered most:
1. Clarity (people deserve straightforward answers, not corporate speak)
2. Dignity (generous severance, extended benefits, placement support)
3. Support (for those leaving AND those staying)

For those impacted:
- I'm happy to provide LinkedIn recommendations
- I'll make intros where I can
- You deserved better timing, and I'm sorry

For the team staying:
- We're committed to getting this right
- Your questions deserve honest answers
- We'll rebuild trust through actions

CTA:
"If you've navigated this as a leader, I'd appreciate your guidance.
And if you're hiring for [roles], several incredible people are looking."

STEP 3: LEGAL REVIEW
□ Send to legal counsel
□ Check: Any liability concerns?
□ Confirm: Severance terms not disclosed (confidential)
□ Ensure: No promises made that company can't keep

STEP 4: PUBLISH + MONITOR
- Time: Not Friday evening (shows lack of care)
- Better: Tuesday-Wednesday (thoughtful timing)
- Monitor: Comments (many will be supportive, some critical)
- Respond: Acknowledge, don't defend

APPROVAL CHAIN:
Draft → Legal → VP Marketing → CHRO → CEO → Publish
Timeline: 3-5 days

RESULT:
- Humanizes difficult decision
- Shows empathy + accountability
- Helps impacted employees (visibility for job search)
- Maintains professional reputation
```

### **Example 3: Fintech Founder, Series A, Regulatory Update Post**

```
SCENARIO:
- Company: Payment aggregator, $4M ARR, 40 employees
- You: Founder & CEO
- Context: RBI just released new PA guidelines
- Goal: Educate fintech community
- Constraint: Legal review mandatory

CONTENT APPROACH:

STEP 1: READ OFFICIAL SOURCE
- RBI circular: Download PDF, read thoroughly
- Identify: 5-7 key changes
- Clarify: What's new vs what's unchanged
- Consult: Legal counsel for interpretation

STEP 2: DRAFT POST (Conservative, Educational)

HOOK:
"RBI released updated Payment Aggregator guidelines yesterday.
Here's what fintech companies need to know:"

BODY:
Key changes (effective April 1, 2026):

1. KYC Requirements Strengthened
- Previous: Basic KYC for merchants
- New: Enhanced due diligence for high-risk categories
- Action: Review your merchant onboarding process

2. Data Localization Timeline
- Previous: "As soon as possible"
- New: Mandatory by June 30, 2026
- Action: If you're not compliant, start now (6-month timeline)

3. Reporting Requirements
- Previous: Quarterly
- New: Monthly submission to RBI
- Action: Update your compliance calendar

4. Net-Worth Requirements
- No change: Still ₹15 crore minimum
- Clarification: Must be maintained at all times

NOT CHANGED (Important):
- License renewal: Still 3 years
- Merchant agreement requirements: Unchanged
- Settlement timelines: Remain T+1

DISCLAIMER:
"This is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.
Always consult qualified legal counsel for your specific situation."

STEP 3: LEGAL REVIEW (1-2 days)
Send to legal counsel:
□ Check factual accuracy
□ Verify no overstatement
□ Confirm disclaimer is appropriate
□ Ensure no competitive mentions

STEP 4: PUBLISH + DISTRIBUTE
- LinkedIn: Tuesday 10 AM IST (India market)
- First comment: Link to official RBI circular
- Distribution: Share in IAMAI fintech group
- Email: Send to customer list (value-add)

RESULT:
- Positions you as: Helpful expert (not sales-y)
- Builds trust: Fintech community appreciates clarity
- Leads: "We need help with compliance" inquiries
- Risk: Zero (factual, legal-reviewed, helpful)

CONTRAST WITH WRONG APPROACH:

❌ DON'T WRITE:
"RBI's new rules will kill most payment companies.
Here's why we're better positioned than our competitors."

WHY IT'S WRONG:
- Fear-mongering (unprofessional)
- Competitor mention (unnecessary)
- Could trigger regulatory scrutiny
```
