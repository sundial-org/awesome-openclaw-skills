# Evidence capture standard (replace with your internal SOP)

For each evidence item:
- Give it a reference number (Ref 1, Ref 2…)
- Capture source and timestamp
- Store in a controlled location (record the path)
- Record integrity notes (e.g., “exported from portal on [date]”, “original file preserved”)
- Record whether/when shared with the employee (if investigation-related)
