# Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework - Detailed Methodology

## The Milkshake Story

Clayton Christensen's famous example:

**Surface Problem:** McDonald's wanted to sell more milkshakes

**Traditional Approach:** Improve flavor, make thicker, add toppings

**JTBD Approach:** What "job" are people hiring the milkshake for?

**Discovery:** 
- Morning buyers: "I need something to make my commute less boring and keep me full until lunch"
- Afternoon buyers: "I want to bond with my kid and feel like a good parent"

**Insight:** SAME product, DIFFERENT jobs, DIFFERENT competition

Morning milkshake competes with: bagels, bananas, boredom
Afternoon milkshake competes with: ice cream, toy stores, playground

## The Job Statement Formula

### Basic Structure
"When [situation/trigger], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

### Examples

**TeddySnaps Parent:**
"When I'm at work and missing my child, I want to see they're happy and engaged, so I can feel like a good parent even though I'm away"

**TISA Parent:**
"When I'm choosing a school, I want my child to develop real-world skills, so I can feel confident they'll succeed in life"

**GolfTab Golfer:**
"When I'm hungry on the course, I want food delivered without disrupting my game, so I can keep enjoying golf without hangry frustration"

## Forces of Progress

Four forces determine whether someone "switches" to your solution:

### Push of Current Situation
What's wrong with how they do it now?
- Pain points
- Frustrations
- Unmet needs

### Pull of New Solution
What's attractive about the alternative?
- Better outcomes
- New capabilities
- Emotional benefits

### Anxiety of New Solution
What fears prevent switching?
- Will it work?
- What if I lose X?
- Is it complicated?

### Habit of Current Situation
What makes staying comfortable?
- Familiarity
- Sunk costs
- "Good enough"

**Switch happens when:** Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

## Discovering Jobs

### Interview Techniques

**Timeline Interview:**
"Walk me through the last time you [action]..."
"What happened right before that?"
"What were you thinking at that moment?"

**Switch Interview:**
"Tell me about when you started using [product]"
"What weren't you happy with before?"
"What almost stopped you from switching?"

**Contrast Interview:**
"When does [solution] work great? When does it fall short?"
"Compare the best experience to the worst experience"

### What to Listen For

- "I need to..." (functional)
- "I want to feel..." (emotional)
- "People will think..." (social)
- "It frustrates me when..." (pain points)
- "I wish I could..." (unmet needs)

JTBD competition: anything that could do the same job

**Netflix's real competitors aren't other streaming services:**

**TeddySnaps' real competitors:**

## Prioritizing Jobs

### Importance Matrix

|           | Well Served | Underserved |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Important | Maintain    | OPPORTUNITY |
| Unimportant| Ignore    | Ignore      |

### Opportunity Score
Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction) = Opportunity

High importance + Low satisfaction = Biggest opportunity

## Integration with Other Skills

- **First Principles**: What's the atomic need behind this job?
- **Second-Order**: If we solve this job, what happens next?
- **Inversion**: What would make us terrible at this job?
- **Cross-Pollination**: Who else solves similar jobs well?
