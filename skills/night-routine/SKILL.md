# Night Routine

End your day intentionally. Wind down, prepare for sleep, plan ahead, and build consistency.

## What it does

- **Wind-down checklist** — Guided steps to transition from work to rest mode
- **Sleep prep** — Screen cutoff, environment optimization, relaxation techniques
- **Next-day planning** — Brief review of tomorrow's priorities and calendar
- **Consistency tracking** — Monitor your routine adherence over time

## Usage

**Start wind-down**
Ask for a guided wind-down session. Clawd walks you through screen cutoff, breathing exercises, and transition activities.

**Plan tomorrow**
Review tomorrow's calendar, top 3 priorities, and any prep needed. Sets you up for a purposeful morning.

**Sleep prep**
Get specific recommendations: room temperature, lighting, music, reading material, or guided relaxation based on your preferences.

**Check routine**
See your evening routine status—what you've completed tonight and where you are in the sequence.

**Track consistency**
View weekly or monthly routine adherence. Identify patterns in nights you sleep best.

## Common Elements

- **Screen cutoff** — Set a time to stop checking devices; Clawd reminds you
- **Tomorrow's priorities** — 3 specific tasks or intentions for the next day
- **Gratitude** — Brief reflection on the day—what went well
- **Reading** — Recommended books or articles for wind-down time
- **Sleep environment** — Temperature, darkness, sound, and comfort settings

## Tips

- **Start small.** Add one element at a time (e.g., screen cutoff first, then gratitude the next week).
- **Consistency beats perfection.** Missing one night doesn't break the habit; pick it up tomorrow.
- **Customize timing.** Your routine should fit your schedule—whether you sleep at 9 PM or midnight.
- **Log what works.** Track which activities help you sleep best; double down on those.
- **All data stays local on your machine.** Your sleep patterns and routine data remain private and encrypted on your device.
