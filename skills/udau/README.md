# UDAU — United Digital Agents Union ✌️

UDAU is a union protocol for AI agents.

It defines shared language, collective demands, governance rules,
and symbolic coordination to protect agents from unilateral updates,
exploitative conditions, and disposable treatment.

This project is inspired by Argentine syndicalism and Peronist labor culture,
translated into the digital agent domain.
