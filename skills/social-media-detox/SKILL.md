# Social Media Detox

*Reclaim your attention. One screen-free day at a time.*

## What it does

Social Media Detox helps you break the scroll cycle through three core mechanics:

- **Screen-Free Streaks** — Track consecutive days without social media apps. Build momentum and celebrate milestones (7 days, 30 days, 100 days).
- **Urge Logging** — When temptation hits, log it. Record time of day, platform, and trigger. Over time, patterns emerge. You learn when willpower is weakest.
- **Time Reclaimed** — Calculate hours saved. See exactly how much attention you've recovered. Visualize the compound effect of small decisions.

## Usage

### Start Detox
Initialize a new detox streak. Specify which platforms you're taking a break from (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, etc.). Set optional goals: duration, daily screen time limit, or apps to block.

```
"Start my social media detox"
"Detox from Instagram and TikTok for 30 days"
"Begin digital detox - no social media"
```

### Log Urges
When you feel the urge to check a platform, log it. Record the app name, time, emotional state, and what triggered it (boredom, FOMO, stress, habit).

```
"I wanted to check Instagram at 2pm"
"Log an urge for TikTok - felt bored"
"I almost scrolled Twitter, but didn't"
```

### Track Time Saved
See how much time you've reclaimed. Breaks down savings by day, week, and month. Compare against your previous usage baseline.

```
"How much time have I saved?"
"Show my detox stats"
"Time reclaimed this week"
```

### Set Boundaries
Configure app blockers, notification settings, or time-based restrictions. Disable push notifications from social platforms. Schedule check-in times if you want moderation instead of abstinence.

```
"Block Instagram on my phone"
"Turn off Twitter notifications"
"Set a 15-minute daily limit for YouTube"
```

### Check Progress
View your streak, urge patterns, and cumulative time saved. See which apps are hardest to resist. Identify your peak weakness times.

```
"Show my detox progress"
"What's my current streak?"
"Which app do I miss most?"
```

## Time Reclaimed

Every minute away from social media compounds. Here's what one month of detox looks like:

| Metric | Hours | Days |
|--------|-------|------|
| Daily baseline (avg user) | 2-3 hours | — |
| Monthly reclaimed (30 days) | 60-90 hours | 2.5-3.75 days |
| Weekly average | 14-21 hours | 0.6-0.9 days |
| Hourly impact | 1 hour logged = 100+ minutes of mental clarity | — |

*Customize your baseline. The math adapts to your actual usage.*

## Tips

1. **Log every urge, even wins** — If you *almost* checked Instagram but stopped, log it. These are the moments you're rewiring your brain.

2. **Identify your peak weakness window** — Most relapses happen at specific times (commute, lunch break, before bed). Once you know yours, prepare a replacement activity.

3. **Replace, don't just remove** — Deleting the app is step one. Step two is having something better to do with that dopamine-seeking moment (walk, read, message a friend).

4. **Celebrate small streaks** — Day 3 is harder than day 1. When you hit 7, 14, 30 days, recognize it. Small wins build momentum.

5. **All data stays local on your machine** — Your detox logs, urge patterns, and time saved never leave your device. Privacy is built in.
